In the interests of SCIENCE (and possibly accidentally DDoSing Randall&rsquo;s image server - sorry!), I created a static HTML file of the <strong><a href=http://blackspherestudios.com/storage/xkcd_huge_static.html>entire composite image</a></strong>.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The collage is made up of 225 images<sup>2</sup> that stretch out over a total image area 79872 pixels high and 165888 pixels wide. The images take up 5.52 MB of space and are named with a simple naming scheme <code>"ydxd.png"</code> where d represents a cardinal direction appropriate for the axis (n for north, s for south on the y axis and e for east, w for west on the x axis) along with the tile coordinate number; for example, <code>"1n1e.png"</code>. Tiles are 2048x2048 png images with an average size of 24.53 KB.

That means the total composite image is approximately 3.63 kilometers high and 7.54 kilometers wide. It would take an average human 1.67 hours to walk from one end of the image to the other. Note that the characters at the far left say they&rsquo;ve been walking for 2 miles - they are 67584 pixels from the starting point, which translates to 3.072 km or ~1.9 miles, so this seems to indicate my rough estimates here are reasonably accurate.</p><p>If Randall spent, on average, one hour drawing each frame, it would take him 9.375 days of constant, nonstop work to finish this. If he instead spent an average of 10 minutes per frame, it would take ~37.5 hours, or almost an entire 40-hour work week.</p><p>Basically I&rsquo;m saying Randall Munroe is fucking insane.</p><span style=font-size:80%><sup>1</sup> If you are on firefox or chrome, right-clicking and selecting "Save as" will download the HTML file along with all 225 images into a separate folder.

<b>Francis Bacon</b><p>Ah, come on. Most of the elements in the assembled image are taken from photo reference, and silhouetted using brightness/contrast functions. There weren't "drawn".<br><br>Don't get me wrong. It's cool.<br><br>But seriously, the full scale image is a project more like a research paper than it is a drawing. It's a matter of gathering usable images, and treating them with filters, and then assembling them. It's like gathering your favorite tracts of text from an encyclopedia, and then running search and replace/spell check functions. Keeping the images in scale with each other, and working with a very large image, while keeping it free of defects are the true difficulties. That problem is solved the same way it's processed, square by square. 225 x 225 is a lot, but many get thrown out as white space or black space.<br><br>Yes, I understand that the picture is annotated with Randall's characters, but those annotations to the image would have been done in-line, while Randall is stitching together the image and inspecting it for flaws.<br><br>I'm not saying it isn't impressive in it's own right, but the scale of it's difficulty should be measured by the count of individual recognizable elements, not it's literal dimensions, or how many tiles. The dimensions are a by-product of the included elements.</p></div><hr><div class=reply id=c3297418448319511209><div class=reply-arrow><i class="fa-solid fa-level-up"></i></div><img src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35" alt>

<b>Aaron Reichert</b><p>I don't think he does it for the money, or for the readers...<br>I think he does it for himself.<br><br>Don't get me wrong he thinks of us as he does what he does, and I am not trying to paint him as any sort of selfish person.<br><br>I think he does stuff that he thinks is cool or fun, stuff he can be proud of. anyone remember when he added depth to all of his comics for a short time?<br><br>Look at this as something done not to reach a goal per say but more to see if he can or to use an idea that he came up with that seems awesome. Suddenly the time consumed becomes less of an issue, and the question goes from why to what is he going to do next? who to tell? who will think this is as awesome as I do?<br><br>and as far as:<br>"Basically I'm saying Randall Munroe is fucking insane."<br><br>Since first finding this comic years ago not once have I thought he was totally sane, and that is why I keep coming back!</p></div></div><div class=comments></div><hr></form></article></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2025</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/technological-tsunami/>The Technological Tsunami</a></li><li><a href=/blog/purity-spiral/>Leftists Are In A Purity Death Spiral</a></li><li><a href=/blog/discord-overlay-breaks-gsync/>The New Discord Overlay Breaks GSync and Borderless Optimizations</a></li><li><a href=/blog/do-you-really-think-we-have-gender-in-the-future/>Do You Really Think We'll Have Genders In The Future?</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2024</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/stop-making-me-memorize-borrow-checker/>Stop Making Me Memorize The Borrow Checker</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rust-async-makes-me-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out/>Rust Async Makes Me Want To Gouge My Eyes Out</a></li><li><a href=/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/>Engineers Only Get Paid If Something Is Broken</a></li><li><a href=/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/>Measuring Competence Is Epistemic Hell</a></li><li><a href=/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/>We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/>People Can't Care About Everything</a></li><li><a href=/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
