Just, pick your favorite reason to hate Windows, and let&rsquo;s pretend that was the tipping point. I had some spare space on my secondary drive, so I decided to give Linux another whirl. After all, it had been three or four years since I last attempted anything like this (it&rsquo;s been so long I don&rsquo;t rightly remember the last time I tried), and people have been saying that Linux has gotten a lot better recently!</p><p>The <em>primary</em> reason I was attempting this is because of <a href=http://store.steampowered.com/steamos>Valve&rsquo;s attempts to move to linux</a>, which have directly resulted in much better nVidia driver support. Trying to install proper nVidia drivers is the thing that wrecked my last attempt. This time, I figured, I could just install the nVidia drivers straight from the repo and everything would be hunky dory, and I could just spend the rest of my time beating on the rest of linux with a comically oversized wrench until it did what I wanted.</p><p>I&rsquo;d had good experiences with <a href=http://www.xfce.org/>XFCE</a> and <a href=https://getfedora.org/>Fedora</a> on my Linux VM, but I didn&rsquo;t really like Fedora itself (but it interfaced very well with my VM environment). I wanted to install <a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/>Ubuntu</a>, because it has the best support and I don&rsquo;t like trying to dig through arcane forum posts trying to figure out why my computer screen has suddenly turned into an invisible pink unicorn. Unfortunately, Ubuntu is a bloated mess, and I <em>hate</em> it&rsquo;s default desktop environment. In the past, I had tried Linux Mint, which had been okay, but support had been shaky. I spotted <a href=http://lubuntu.net/>Lubuntu</a>, which is supposed to be a lightweight ubuntu on top of LXDE, a minimal window manager similar to XFCE. This was perfect! So I downloaded Lubuntu 15.04 and installed it on my secondary drive and everything was nice and peachy.</p><p>Well, until Linux started, anyway. The first problem was that the package manager in pretty much every linux distro lists <em>all</em> the packages, including all the ones I don&rsquo;t understand. I was trying to remove some pre-included Paint application and it had two separate packages, one named after itself, and one named <code>&lt;name>-common</code>, but the common package wasn&rsquo;t automatically removed when the program was! The nVidia packages also had both an nvidia-drivers-340<sup><a href=#footnote1>[1]</a></sup> package, and an nvidia-drivers-340-update package, both of which had identical descriptions. I just went with the most basic one because it seemed sensible, but I felt really sorry for someone less tech savvy trying to find <em>anything</em> in that godforsaken list.</p><p>So after everything updated and I restarted and told the package manager to start installing my nVidia drivers, I started noticing annoying things about LXDE. A lot of annoying things. Here, let me list them for you:</p><ul><li>The file manager, when unmounting anything, would helpfully close itself.</li><li>Trying to change the time to not display military time involves editing some arcane string whose only value is <code>%r</code>, and I still don&rsquo;t know what that means and don&rsquo;t want to know what that means. All I wanted to do was change it to say AM or PM!</li><li>In order to get a shortcut onto the desktop, you had to <em>right-click the menu item</em> and then a new menu would show up that would let you add it to the desktop. You can&rsquo;t drag anything out of the start menu.</li><li>The shortcuts seemed disturbingly fickle, occasionally taking 4 rapid clicks to get things to start up.</li><li>Steam simply didn&rsquo;t start <em>at all</em>. Unfortunately, we will never know why.</li><li>Skype managed to spawn a window halfway above the top of the screen, which resulted in me having to look up <code>alt+space</code> in order to rescue it.</li><li>Skype also cut off everything below the baseline of the bottom-most line of text, so you couldn&rsquo;t tell if something was an i or a j.</li><li>Like in Windows, in Linux, modal dialogs have a really bad habit of sucking up keyboard focus, focusing on a button, and then making my next keystroke click the button. The fact that this is a widespread UI problem across most operating systems is just silly.</li></ul><p>There were more nitpicks, but I felt like a large number of these issues could have probably be resolved by switching to a better window manager. I was honestly expecting better than this, though. LXDE was <em>supposed</em> to be like XFCE, but apparently it&rsquo;s actually XCFE with all it&rsquo;s redeeming qualities removed. However, it turns out that <em>this doesn&rsquo;t matter!</em> To discover why, we have to examine what happened next.</p><p>My friend suggested to get Linux Mint, which has a better window manager and would probably address most of those issues. So, I downloaded the ISO. I already had a USB set up for booting that had Lubuntu on it, so I wanted to see if I could just extract the contents of the ISO and put them on the USB stick. I have no idea if this would have actually worked or not, and I never got to find out because upon clicking and dragging the contents of the ISO out of the archive manager, with the intent of extracting them, <em>the entire system locked up</em>.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m not sure how stupid trying to drag a file out of an ISO was, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it shouldn&rsquo;t <em>render my entire computer unusable</em>. This seems like an unfair punishment. Attempts to recover the desktop utterly failed, as did <code>ctrl-alt-del</code>, <code>alt-F2</code>, <code>alt-</code>anything else, or even trying to open a terminal (my friend would later inform me that it is actually <code>*ctrl-alt-F2*</code> that opens the terminal, but I couldn&rsquo;t ask him because <em>the entire desktop had locked up!</em>). So I just restarted the machine.</p><p>That was the last time I saw my Lubuntu desktop.</p><p>Upon restarting my machine, I saw the Lubuntu loading screen come up, and then&mldr; nothing. Blackness. About 20 seconds later, an error message pops up: &ldquo;Soft Lock on CPU#0!&rdquo;. Then the machine rebooted.</p><p>After spending just <em>one hour</em> using linux, it had bricked itself.<sup><a href=#footnote2>[2]</a></sup> I hadn&rsquo;t even gotten steam working yet, and now it was completely unusable. This is not &ldquo;getting better&rdquo;, this is strapping a rocket to your ass and going so fast in the wrong direction you break the sound barrier. Now, if you have been paying attention, you will note that I had just finished installing my nVidia drivers before the desktop locked up, and that the drivers probably wouldn&rsquo;t actually be used by the desktop environment until the process was restarted. After mounting my linux partition in windows and extracting my log files, I sent them to my friend, who discovered that it had indeed been the nVidia driver that had crashed the system.<sup><a href=#footnote3>[3]</a></sup></p><p>This is problematic for a number of reasons, because those drivers were written for Ubuntu based distros, which means my system could potentially lock up if I installed any other ubuntu based distro, which is&mldr; just about all the ones that I cared about. Including Linux Mint. At this point, I had a few options:</p><ol><li>Install another ubuntu based distro anyway and hope it was a fluke.</li><li>Install something based on Debian or maybe Fedora.</li><li>Use the open-source drivers.</li><li><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FjWe31S_0g">Fuck this shit.</a></em></li></ol><p>Unfortunately, I have little patience left at this point, and after seeing Linux first <em>lock up after trying to drag files</em> before <em>bricking itself</em>, I don&rsquo;t really have much confidence in the reverse-engineered open-source nVidia drivers, and I certainly am not going to entrust my video card to them in the hopes it doesn&rsquo;t melt. I really, <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to play whack-a-mole with Linux distros, trying to find the magical one that <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> wreck my graphics card, so I have simply opted for option 4.</p><p>But it doesn&rsquo;t end there.</p><p>About two or three hours after this all happened (I had been fairly distracted, and by distracted I mean <span class=imghover><img src=https://googledrive.com/host/0B_2aDNVL_NGmUlp0bnh3Z3hUeWc/>}}<a href=javascript:void()>blinded by rage</a></span>), I noticed that my windows clock was way off. At this point, I remembered something my friend had told me about - Linux, like any sane operating system would, sets the hardware clock to UTC and then modifies it based on the timezone. Windows, on the other hand, decided it would be a fantastic idea to set the hardware clock to <em>local time</em>. Of course, this should have been an easy fix. I just set the time back, forced an update, and bam, time was accurate again. Crisis averted, right?</p><p>No, of course not. Linux had not yet finished punishing me for foolishly believing I was worthy of installing something of it&rsquo;s calibre. Because then I opened Skype, and started receiving messages <em>in the past</em>. Or more accurately, my chat logs were now full of messages that had been sent <em>tomorrow</em>.</p><p>It was at this point I realized what had happened. It wasn&rsquo;t that the timezone had been changed, or something reversible like that. The <em>hardware clock itself</em> had been modified to an incorrect value. Skype had spent the past two hours happily sending messages with a timestamp <em>8 hours in the future</em> because some idiot at Microsoft thought it was a good idea to set the hardware clock to local time, and now all these incorrect client side timestamps had been propagated to the cloud and synced across all my devices.</p><p>I slowly got up from my computer. I walked over to my bed, lied down, curled into a ball, and wept for the future of mankind.</p><p><center><iframe width=420 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIWHMb3JxmE frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></center><hr><sup><a name=footnote1>1</a></sup> I may have gotten these package names slightly wrong, but I can&rsquo;t verify them because <em>Linux won&rsquo;t boot up!</em>
<sup><a name=footnote2>2</a></sup> It&rsquo;s probably entirely possible to rescue the system by mounting the file system and modifying the x config file to not use nvidia, but this was supposed to just be &ldquo;install linux and set it up&rdquo;, not &ldquo;install linux and spend the next 5 hours frantically trying to get it to boot properly.&rdquo;
<sup><a name=footnote3>3</a></sup> After submitting my log files to #ubuntu to report the issue, my friend discovered that the drivers for ATI/AMD graphics drivers are also currently broken for many ubuntu users. What timing! This certainly makes me feel confident about using this operating system!</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2015-07-21T00:45:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-tried-to-install-linux-and-now-i/>July 21, 2015 at 12:45am</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-tried-to-install-linux-and-now-i%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#888}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20Tried%20To%20Install%20Linux%20And%20Now%20I%20Regret%20Everything&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-tried-to-install-linux-and-now-i%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#888}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-tried-to-install-linux-and-now-i%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#888}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><a name=comments><h4>Comments</h4></a><hr><div class=comments><div id=c4751228645406544520><div class=reply-arrow><i class="fa-solid fa-level-up"></i></div><img src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35" alt>
