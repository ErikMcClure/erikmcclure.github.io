What kept me optimistic was <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism>transhumanism</a>, the belief that, even if the average human is too dumb to ever sustain an interstellar empire, we are rapidly approaching the point at which we can augment our own intelligence and move beyond the constraints of our biology. Perhaps then, the way forward was through augmentation, either mechanical, biological, or simply uploading ourselves to computers somehow. This possible future, however, is now at risk, it&rsquo;s very existence looking very unlikely.</p><p>In 10-20 years, we will likely see one of three things happen: radical biological modification from bioengineering DNA, the rise of androids thanks to the <a href=https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-medicine/how-ecmo-is-redefining-death>minificiation of ECMO systems</a>, or partial mind uploading made possibly by <a href=https://futurism.com/neoscope/gaben-steam-bci-stealth>brain-computer interfaces</a>.</p><p>However, this election has made two things painfully clear: a majority of people are very dumb, and a majority of people hate what they don&rsquo;t understand. This means they are definitely going to hate anything coming out of the transhumanist movement. Any attempt I make to augment myself will be met with fear, hostility, and guns. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re just &ldquo;scared and confused&rdquo;, they&rsquo;ll still shoot me all the same. And, y&rsquo;know, the threat of being shot is very good at dissuading people from doing things.</p><p>People do not seem to understand just how bad things are going to get. You can say &ldquo;how bad can 4 years be?&rdquo; and be somewhat right: I think Trump is too senile to actually dismantle American democracy. That&rsquo;s not the problem. The problem is that this entire election has solidified conservative power in a big way. Do you really think they&rsquo;ll stop at concentration camps for &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; immigrants? I can see today&rsquo;s waves crash into tomorrow&rsquo;s shores, and it&rsquo;s not pretty.</p><p><center><a href=/img/doom.png target=_blank><img src=/img/doom.png alt="Holy shit everyone in the office is like, Pro trump rn. Even tho its awful for canada. They literally told me climate change isnt real"></a></center></p><p>Part of <a href=https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf>Project 2025</a> says they are going to dismantle all attempts at addressing climate change. This means you&rsquo;d better familiarize yourself with <a href=https://time.com/5824295/climate-change-future-possibilities/>what things will look like in 2050</a> without any reduction in emissions, because that&rsquo;s what is going to happen. Don&rsquo;t buy a house unless it will survive a <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=7cd8267378414c57a39d19a3faf54cf0&amp;layerId=0">70 meter rise in sea levels</a>.</p><p>The cruel irony is that this will fuel an explosion in VR entertainment in the next 5-10 years that will cause hundreds of millions of people to realize they aren&rsquo;t as normal as they thought they were, only to be thrown into a world of their own making that hates them for it. The sheer amount of suffering that we have created in this moment is mind-boggling. 4 years of Trump is nothing compared to the decades of civil rights unrest that we are about to plow into. Did you really think they were going to stop at attacking trans people? They&rsquo;ve already been gearing up to go against furries. The bigotry will never stop, because there will be a never ending supply of people they hate - anyone who is different from them, anyone with the wrong &ldquo;vibes&rdquo;, anyone who isn&rsquo;t an heterosexual cisgendered extrovert is going to be ground into dust or thrown into a camp.</p><p>The astounding success of fearmongering conservative politics means the dystopian world of Dues Ex is somehow <em>optimistic</em>, one where augmentation was possible <em>at all</em>. Given the current political climate, it seems unlikely that widespread augmentation will ever be tolerated. The rich will find ways to get augmented, and then simply fearmonger all the poor people into ensuring none of the other poor people get augmented, which is exactly what the cartoon villains in Dues Ex wanted. Drone warfare will become commonplace. Civilians will become targets. Scientific progress will be heavily bottlenecked, as rampant elitism makes herding behavior much worse.</p><p>I no longer see any viable way out of this for humanity as a whole. Perhaps if we splinter into factions, one of us might get lucky and colonize the moon, or something, from inside the comfort of a glass dome. But right now, we are in a crab bucket, and this election has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that humans will do anything they can to drag everyone else down to their level. The only escape now is to hide from the other crabs, so that one small group might be able to continue making progress.</p><p>Either way, this will probably be my last blog post, unless something changes. I may be forced to delete the blog entirely, given how everything on this website will inevitably be weaponized against me. Besides, I no longer have any desire to talk to other people. I&rsquo;d rather buy a gun.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2024-11-06T16:00:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/dumb-people-will-shoot-me-all-the-same/>November 6, 2024 at 4:00pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/dumb-people-will-shoot-me-all-the-same/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdumb-people-will-shoot-me-all-the-same%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dumb%20People%20Will%20Shoot%20Me%20All%20The%20Same&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdumb-people-will-shoot-me-all-the-same%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdumb-people-will-shoot-me-all-the-same%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/rust-async-makes-me-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out/>Rust Async Makes Me Want To Gouge My Eyes Out</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>One of the most fundamental problems with Rust is the design of <code>Result</code>. It is a lightweight, standardized error return value, similar to C-style error codes but implemented at a type system level that can contain arbitrary information. They are easy to use and very useful, and the ecosystem encourages you to use them over <code>panic!</code> whenever possible. Unfortunately, this ends up creating a problem. <code>Result</code> is not like a C++ exception because it doesn&rsquo;t contain a stacktrace by default, nor does the compiler have any idea where it was first constructed, unless the error type it contains decides to include that information upon construction by using <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/backtrace/index.html>backtrace</a>.</p><p><a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html>You can catch</a> an unwinding <code>panic!</code>, which is implemented much more like a C++ exception, but a <code>panic!</code> that aborts cannot be caught and it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if a panic will unwind at compile-time because <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.always_abort.html>the behavior can be changed at runtime</a>. Another interesting difference is that the panic handler is invoked before the panic starts unwinding the stack. These implementation details push you towards using the panic handlers purely as uncaught exception handlers, when you can do nothing but perhaps save critical information and dump a stacktrace before exiting. As a result, <code>panic!</code> is designed for and used almost exclusively for unrecoverable errors.</p><p>If you want an error that is recoverable, you use <code>Result</code>&mldr; which doesn&rsquo;t have a backtrace, unless you and all your dependencies are using some variant of <code>anyhow</code> (or it&rsquo;s various forks), which allows you to <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42275777/how-to-trace-the-cause-of-an-error-result>add backtrace information</a>. If the error is coming from a dependency that doesn&rsquo;t use anyhow, you&rsquo;re screwed. There actually is <a href=https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53487>an RFC to fix this</a>, but it&rsquo;s been open for six years and shows no signs of being merged anytime soon.</p><p>&ldquo;But&rdquo;, I hear you ask, &ldquo;what does this have to do with Rust Async?&rdquo; Well, like most things, Rust Async makes this annoying part of Rust <em>twice as annoying</em> because the default behavior is to <em>silently eat the error and drop the future</em>, unless you have stored the join handle somewhere, <em>and</em> you are in a position where you can access that join handle to find out what the actual error was. The API for making tokio panic when an unhandled panic happens is <a href=https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/4516>still unstable</a>, with the interesting comment of &ldquo;dropping errors silently is definitely the correct default behavior&rdquo;. Really? In <em><strong>debug mode?</strong></em> In release mode, fine, that&rsquo;s reasonable, but if I&rsquo;ve compiled my program <em>in debug mode</em> I&rsquo;m pretty sure I want to know if random errors are being thrown. Even with this API change, you&rsquo;ll have to manually opt-in to it, they won&rsquo;t helpfully default to this behavior when you compile in debug mode.</p><p>Until that feature gets stabilized, you basically have to throw all your <code>JoinHandle</code>&rsquo;s into a <code>JoinSet</code> blender so you can tell when something errored out, and unless you are <em>extremely sure</em> you didn&rsquo;t accidentally drop any <code>JoinHandle</code>&rsquo;s on the floor (because Rust <em>does not warn you if you do this</em>), you probably need a timeout function even after your main future has returned, in case there are zombie tasks that are still deadlocked.</p><p>Oh, have I mentioned deadlocks? Because that&rsquo;s what Rust async gives you instead of errors. Did you forget to await something? Deadlock. Did you await things in the wrong order? Deadlock. Did you forget to store the join handle and an error happened? Deadlock. Did you call a syncronous function that invokes the async runtime 5 layers deep in the callstack because it doesn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s already inside an async call and you forgot it tried to do that? Deadlock. Did you implement a poll() function incorrectly? Deadlock.</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPFiKEm-oNI?si=yW7sV5uo25Uu37o7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin allowfullscreen></iframe><p>For simple deadlocks, something like <a href=https://github.com/tokio-rs/console>tokio-console</a> <em><strong>might</strong></em> be able to tell you something useful (&ldquo;might&rdquo; is doing a lot of work here). However, any time you forget to await something, or don&rsquo;t call join on the localset, or add things to the wrong localset, or your poll function isn&rsquo;t returning the right value, or the async waker was called incorrectly, you&rsquo;re just screwed, because there is no list of &ldquo;pending futures that have not been awaited yet&rdquo; that you can look through, unless you get saved by your IDE noticing you didn&rsquo;t await the future, which it often doesn&rsquo;t. It definitely doesn&rsquo;t tell you about accidentally dropping a <code>JoinHandle</code>, which is one of the most common issues.</p><p>But why would you have to implement a poll function? That&rsquo;s reserved for advanced users&ndash; Nope, nope, actually you have to do that when implementing literally any <code>AsyncRead</code>/<code>AsyncWrite</code> trait. Oh, sorry, there&rsquo;s actually<a href=https://github.com/nrc/portable-interoperable/issues/5> 4 different possible <code>AsyncRead</code>/<code>AsyncWrite</code> implementations</a> and they&rsquo;re all slightly different and completely incompatible with each other, but they&rsquo;re all equally easy to fuck up. Everything in Rust Async is absurdly easy to fuck up, and your reward is always the same: <code>[your-program].exe has been running for over 60 seconds</code>.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned how the tokio and futures runtimes are almost the same but have subtle differences between them, and tokio relies on aspects of futures that have been factored out into <code>future-util</code>, which should be in the standard library but isn&rsquo;t because the literal only thing they actually standardized on was <code>std::future</code> itself. All this is ignoring the usual complaints about async function color-coding - I&rsquo;m complaining about obnoxious implementation footguns <em>on top of</em> all the usual annoyances involved with poll-based async. Trying to use async is like trying to use a hammer made out of hundreds of tiny footguns hot-glued together.</p><p>I wish async was just one cursed corner of Rust that had its warts relatively self-contained, but that isn&rsquo;t the case. Rust async is a microcosm of an endless stream of basic usability problems that the language simply doesn&rsquo;t fix, and might not ever fix. I&rsquo;m honestly not sure how they&rsquo;re going to fix the <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/borrow-splitting.html>split-borrow problem</a> because the type system isn&rsquo;t powerful enough to encode where a particular borrow came from, which is required to implement spatially disjoint borrows, which ends up creating an endless cascade of <a href=https://users.rust-lang.org/t/split-borrow-of-struct-in-a-refcell/41115>subtle complications</a>.</p><p>For example, there are quite a few cases where serde_json errors <a href=https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2711>are not very helpful</a>. None of these situations would matter if you could open a debugger and go straight to what was throwing the error, but you can&rsquo;t because this is Rust and serde_json doesn&rsquo;t implement <code>anyhow</code> so you can&rsquo;t inject any errors. <a href=https://github.com/AlexanderThaller/format_serde_error>format_serde_error</a> was created to solve this exact problem, but it is no longer maintained and <a href=https://github.com/AlexanderThaller/format_serde_error/issues/20>is buggy</a>. Also, <a href=https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9096>artifact dependencies still aren&rsquo;t stabilized</a>, despite the very obvious use-case of needing to test inter-process communication that comes up in basically any process management framework? So <a href=https://crates.io/crates/test-binary>this crazy hack</a> exists instead.</p><p>Rust&rsquo;s ecosystem <em>heavily</em> relies on two undebuggable-by-default constructions: macros and async, which makes actually learning how to debug production Rust code about as fun as pulling your own teeth out. I have legitimately had an easier time hunting down <em>memory corruption errors in C++</em> then trying to figure out where a particular error is being thrown when it is hidden inside a macro inside an error with no stacktrace information, because C++ has mature tooling for hunting down various kinds of memory errors.</p><p>Because of <a href=https://soasis.org/posts/statement-on-rustconf-compile-time-introspection/>last year&rsquo;s shenanigans</a>, I am no longer confident that any of these problems will be fixed anymore. Rust&rsquo;s development has slowed to a crawl, and it seems like it&rsquo;ll take years to stabilize features like <a href=https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/variadic-generics-design-sketch/18974/3>variadic generics</a>, which are currently still in the design phase despite <a href=https://equestria.social/@cloudhop/113080310647278940>all the problems</a> the ecosystem runs into without them. It is extremely frustrating to see comments saying &ldquo;<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/etsnh8/comment/fflqhqe/>oh the ecosystem is just immature</a>&rdquo; when those comments are <em>5 years old</em>. On the other hand, I am tired of clueless C or C++ fans trying to throw bricks at Rust over these kinds of problems when C++ has <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/zc-cplusplus?view=msvc-170">far</a> <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10613126/what-are-the-differences-between-std-c11-and-std-gnu11>worse</a> <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17789928/whats-a-proper-way-of-type-punning-a-float-to-an-int-and-vice-versa>sins</a>.

The thing is, this is not a phenomenon unique to C developers, or even software developers in general, although the visibility of the kernel C developers is higher than the average programmer. Most people will be upset about technology that makes their particular skillset irrelevent. This is best summarized by a famous quote:</p><blockquote>"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it" — <a href=https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/30/salary/>Upton Sinclair</a></blockquote><p>Professional C developers who dislike Rust&rsquo;s borrow checker are almost always extremely good at doing manual memory management while making very few detectable errors (I say detectable because they usually miss some edge-case that turns into a security nightmare 10 years later). They are either paid lots of money to do this specific task, or they have almost no experience doing anything else. They are one-trick ponies, and they are terrified of their one skill being made irrelevent, at which point they will either no longer make lots of money, or not have a job at all.</p><p>You could argue that they could simply <em>learn Rust</em>, but you must understand that they believe they are <em>singularly talented at C</em>, which in some cases may actually be true. If they start learning Rust now, they might end up just being an <em>average</em> Rust developer, and the thought of being <em>average</em> is <strong>absolutely terrifying to them</strong>. This is because it&rsquo;s percieved to be a <em>loss of social status</em>, which human brains are hardwired to avoid at all costs. It sounds like they&rsquo;re about to be &ldquo;deported&rdquo; because that is the exact psychological response that potentially losing social status provokes.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not just languages, either. When programmers ask &ldquo;why is this ecosystem such a disaster&rdquo;, half the time it&rsquo;s because somebody is getting paid to deal with it. Our industry is trapped in an endless loop of a startup building a new technology on top of some half-broken ecosystem, exploding in popularity, and then everyone using the startup&rsquo;s technology hires people to deal with the ecosystem it&rsquo;s built on top of, and those people don&rsquo;t actually want anyone to fix it or they&rsquo;ll be out of a job. There is no escaping the fact that, if someone was getting paid to deal with something that was broken, and you fix it, you just made them irrelevent.</p><p>In 30 years, when Rust is slowly being replaced by something better, Rust developers will behave the <em>exact</em> same way. Someone will invent a borrow checker that is much more powerful and capable of solving most of the annoying borrow situations that baffle the current Rust borrow checker. Their response will be that this language is for &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; programmers, who don&rsquo;t want to be as <em>precise</em> as a Real Rust Programmer. They&rsquo;ll complain about things that don&rsquo;t make any sense because they&rsquo;ve never actually used the language they&rsquo;re complaining about. The Rust programmers will sound just as dumb as C programmers do today.</p><p>I know this will happen because this already happens in literally every other field in existence. Musicians <em>still</em> sometimes claim that if you can&rsquo;t play an actual instrument you aren&rsquo;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; musician, whatever that is. There was a big fight when Photoshop came out because artists complained that &ldquo;ctrl-Z&rdquo; was cheating and if you can&rsquo;t paint on a real canvas you aren&rsquo;t a Real Artist. It&rsquo;s everywhere, and it&rsquo;s universal.</p><p>This is not a programmer problem, it&rsquo;s a people problem. When you look at this through the lens of livelihoods being threatened, you can instantly see that this is all the exact same instinctual human reaction: they have a high status because they are incredibly skilled at a particular thing, and New Thing is threatening to make that skill either irrelevent, or less important, and they don&rsquo;t want to <em>lose status</em>.</p><p>The best defense against this behavior seems to be skill generalization and good self-esteem. If you are confident in your abilities as a musician, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about people who are good at using a sequencer, instead you might <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjpOzsQ9YI">try to team up with them</a>. If you are confident in your general problem solving abilities as a programmer, then the language barely matters, what matters is which language is best suited for the problem at hand.</p><p>Software engineering in particular seems to suffer from hyper-specialization, with people having jobs working with extremely specific frameworks, like React, or Kubernetes, or whatever the newest Javascript framework is. It might be that the complexity of our problems are outstripping our tool&rsquo;s abstractions, but regardless of what the cause is, if we don&rsquo;t get things under control soon, this will just keep getting worse.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2024-08-31T15:35:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/>August 31, 2024 at 3:35pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fengineers-only-get-paid-something-broken%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Engineers%20Only%20Get%20Paid%20If%20Something%20Is%20Broken&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fengineers-only-get-paid-something-broken%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fengineers-only-get-paid-something-broken%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/>Measuring Competence Is Epistemic Hell</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law>Sturgeon&rsquo;s law</a> states that 90% of everything is crap. Combined with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor>Hanlon&rsquo;s Razor</a>, we arrive at the inescapable conclusion that most problems are caused by incompetence. What&rsquo;s particularly interesting is that the number of incompetent people in a system tends to increase the higher up you go. Part of this is due to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle>Peter Principle</a>, where organizations promote employees until they become incompetent, but this happens in the first place because it becomes <em>harder to measure competence&rsquo;</em> the longer it takes the effects of actions to be felt, and as a species we have no way of measuring long-term incompetence. Instead, we rely on social cues, and tend to use whatever our local culture determines is &ldquo;competent&rdquo;.</p><p>One way to try to address this is to teach better critical thinking, but this almost always runs into fierce objections from parents who don&rsquo;t want schools to &ldquo;undermine parental authority&rdquo;, which is what happened with <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/texas-gop-rejects-critical-thinking-skills-really/2012/07/08/gJQAHNpFXW_blog.html>the 2012 Republican Party of Texas platform</a> (<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630113751/http://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012-Platform-Final.pdf>original</a>). This kind of thinking is actually fairly common, and it is not a fluke of human nature - it is a <em>feature</em>.</p><p>To understand why humans can be inquisitive and intelligent on an individual level, but follow arbitrary and sometimes counterproductive rituals on a cultural level, you must understand that <a href=https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/>our ancestors lived in epistemic hell</a>. My favorite example is the tribe that had a very long and complicated ritual for preparing manioc, which contained dangerous amounts of cyanide:</p><blockquote>In the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more days, when they can then be baked and eaten.<br><br>[..] even if the processing was ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms.<br><br>So, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem fine. [..] Consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She’d find that with a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning.<br><br>Thus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. &mdash; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Our-Success-Evolution-Domesticating-ebook/dp/B00WY4OXAS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=the+secret+of+our+success&qid=1559607052&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=slatestarcode-20&linkId=761afd67f6541a6de5cebbd0127aa910&language=en_US">"The Secret Of Our Success" by Joseph Henrich</a></blockquote><p>Without modern tools, there is no possible way (other than <em>acquiring brain damage from chronic cyanide poisoning</em>), for an ancient human to realize that every step of the ritual is actually necessary, because without extensive experimentation over many human lifetimes, it isn&rsquo;t obvious what danger the ritual is guarding against, and if it&rsquo;s working as intended, no one will have seen the danger or be able to know about it in the first place! It seems that evolution always kept around enough sacrificial intelligent humans to tinker with new possible rituals, but always ensured that the majority of the population would obey the safe, known ways of doing things, <em><strong>without questioning them</strong></em>, because trying to rationally evaluate an opaque ritual meant death. <em>Not even the culture itself</em> knew what disaster or point of failure the ritual was actually preventing, only that it kept them alive. Religion is simply a convenient way of packaging rituals; if you look in the rules set out by many ancient religions, a lot of them start looking like &ldquo;how to run a functioning society&rdquo; and include things like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_god>&ldquo;keep your toilet clean&rdquo;</a>. They got popular because they worked, we just had <em>no idea why</em> and in many cases <em>couldn&rsquo;t have possibly figured out why</em> with the technology at the time. Even worse, if you got it wrong, it could take you decades until you finally manifested an affliction that actually started causing problems.</p><p>This is the core evolutionary drive behind religion and conservative mindsets, where obeying authority is paramount to survival. In modern times, we could communicate to our children why doing a particular thing is bad, because we know the entire chain of cause and effect. Just a few hundred years ago, we couldn&rsquo;t even do that! A famous example is the effort to <a href=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v45/n23/jonah-goodman/a-national-evil>get iodine added to salt</a>. Doctors didn&rsquo;t resist the idea of adding iodine to salt for no reason, they resisted it because at every dosage amount that seemed like it could have an effect, it made people sick! They had experiments on fish that showed that iodine seemed to make goiters go away, but giving people iodine supplements would always make them sick. At this point in time, nobody had <em>any evidence whatsoever</em> that micronutrients existed. Giving people just 150 micrograms of iodine a day, accomplished by evenly mixing tiny grains of potassium iodide into a kilogram of salt, seemed like homeopathic medicine. There was no known substance that had any effect at that little concentration. Only by taking a leap of faith could Otto Bayard theorize that perhaps we needed just a tiny amount of iodine, going against all known nutritional science at the time.</p><p>Humans likely evolved culture as an alternative to animal&rsquo;s reliance on old pack members to know what to do in case an extremely rare but devastating event happened every hundred-ish years. Rituals could seem completely nonsensical inside a single human lifespan, because they addressed problems at a societal level that only happened every 200 years, or slow acting chronic issues. In one case, <a href=https://global.wcs.org/Wildlife/Global-Priority-Species/African-Elephants/African-Savannah-Elephant.aspx>ancient elephant matriarchs</a> were the only ones capable of remembering waterholes far enough from a drought that only happened once every 35 years. The packs that lost their matriarchs all died because they had lost this knowledge.</p><p>We evolved logic to solve problems that had clear first-order effects, but we aren&rsquo;t very good at evaluating <a href=https://www.quora.com/What-are-second-order-effects-consequences-and-some-examples-of-them>second-order effects</a>. Long lived humans were capable of finding cause and effect links that happened over a human lifespan, but only human culture perpetuating strange and bizarre rituals created out of random experimentation could deal with problems that had very long, unknowable cause and effect chains. It is very hard to tell if the person building your house is competent if the house only collapses every 150 years when a massive earthquake hits. Various cultures have developed all sorts of indirect methods of measuring competence, but many of them emphasize students obeying their teachers, because the teachers are often perpetuating rituals that are critically important without actually understanding why the rituals are important or what they guard against. It is culture guarding against <a href=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chesterton%27s_fence>Chesterton&rsquo;s fence</a> over enormous timespans. Another good example of epistemic hell is how we cured scurvy by accident <a href=https://www.secretorum.life/p/epistemic-hell>and then ruined the cure</a>:</p><blockquote>Originally, the Royal Navy was given lemon juice, which works well because it contains a lot of vitamin C. But at some point between 1799 and 1870, someone switched out lemons for limes, which contain a lot less vitamin C. Worse, the lime juice was pumped through copper tubing as part of its processing, which destroyed the little vitamin C that it had to begin with.<br><br>This ended up being fine, because ships were so much faster at this point that no one had time to develop scurvy. So everything was all right until 1875, when a British arctic expedition set out on an attempt to reach the North Pole. They had plenty of lime juice and thought they were prepared — but they all got scurvy. The same thing happened a few more times on other polar voyages, and this was enough to convince everyone that citrus juice doesn’t cure scurvy.</blockquote><p>Our ancestors weren&rsquo;t stupid. They were trying to find some kind of logical progression of cause-and-effect, but they lived in epistemic hell. This is why cargo-cult programming exists. This is why urban legends persist. This is why parents simply want their children to do as they say. This is why we have youtubers chastising NASA for <a href="https://yt.drgnz.club/watch?v=OoJsPvmFixU">not reading their own Apollo 11 postmortem</a>. This is why corporate procedures emphasize checking boxes instead of critically examining the problem. When your cause-and-effect chain is a hundred steps long and caused by something 5 years ago, economic pressure incentivizes simply trying to avoid blame instead of trying to find the actual systemic problem. The farther up the chain of management a problem is, the longer it takes for the effects to be felt, and the worse we get at finding the root cause. Software engineering has the same issue, where incompetence may only cause performance issues years later, after the original coder has left, and the system has scaled up beyond a critical breaking point. This is <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/factorio-is-best-interview-we-have/>why we still don&rsquo;t know how to hire programmers</a>.</p><p>Only in the modern era do we have the necessary technological progress <em>and the historical records</em> to be able to accurately evaluate the usefulness of our rituals.

They had to infer it from experimentation, whereas I can just <em>watch it happen</em> and immediately understand exactly what is going on. We live in a pivotal moment of human history, on the cusp of being able to truly understand <em>the entire chain</em> of cause-and-effect for why things happen. We have the ability to measure events with unprecedented accuracy, to tease out tiny differences that catalyze huge reactions.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ability to merely see cause-and-effect is not sufficient when large systems tend to be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory>chaotic</a>. We do not yet have good mathematical frameworks for predicting emergent behavior, and our ability to analyze complex chaotic systems is still in its infancy. We know that large groups of humans consistently display emergent behavior, such as crowd dynamics closely following the equations of fluid dynamics. Likewise, large human organizations are themselves largely emergent behavior, and we never really understood how they were working in the first place. Organizational competence, and <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/>coordination problems in general</a> are our modern epistemic hell, and it means there is no easy way for us to address the failure of our institutions, because we still have no holistic way to analyze the effectiveness of a given organization.</p><p>We are tantalizingly close to grasping the true nature of reality, to having the machinations of the universe laid out before us, but we are still missing the tools to fully analyze subtle patterns, to lift a whispered signal out of the thundering noise of spacetime. There is simply no escape from emergent behaviors evolving out of chaotic systems. Until we have the means to analyze these kinds of complex systems, we will forever be at odds with our nature, still tempted to cling on to superstitions of old, because long ago, that was the only thing that kept us alive.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2024-04-30T17:30:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/>April 30, 2024 at 5:30pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmeasuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Measuring%20Competence%20Is%20Epistemic%20Hell&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmeasuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmeasuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/>We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>[programmers frantically pulling cables out of the wall]<br><br>AI: "Nuclear power. Double teachers' salaries. Build more houses. Distribute food more fairly. TRAINS—"</p>&mdash; qntmyrrh (@qntm) <a href="https://twitter.com/qntm/status/1728178227355763063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>I remember growing up with that same old adage of how you could be the next scientist to invent a cure for cancer, or a solution to climate change, or whatever. What they don&rsquo;t tell you is that we already have solutions for a <strong>lot</strong> of problems, we just don&rsquo;t use them. Sometimes this is because the solution is too expensive, but usually it&rsquo;s because competing interests create a tragedy of the commons. Most problems in the modern age aren&rsquo;t complicated engineering problems, they&rsquo;re the same problem: coordination failure.</p><p>It was recently unveiled that basically every single UEFI SecureBoot implementation ever made <a href=https://binarly.io/posts/finding_logofail_the_dangers_of_image_parsing_during_system_boot/index.html>can be bypassed with a <em><strong>malicious image file</strong></em></a>. This means that any manufacturer that allows the user to customize the boot image is now vulnerable to a complete bypass of SecureBoot <em>and</em> Intel Boot Guard. Luckily, the fix for this is pretty simple: don&rsquo;t make the logo customizable. But how did something this absurd happen in the first place?</p><blockquote>The results from our fuzzing and subsequent bug triaging unequivocally say that none of these image parsers were ever tested by IBVs or OEMs. We can confidently say this because we found crashes in almost every parser we tested. Moreover, the fuzzer was able to find the first crashes after running just for a few seconds and, even worse, certain parsers were crashing on valid images found on the Internet. &mdash; <a href=https://binarly.io/posts/finding_logofail_the_dangers_of_image_parsing_during_system_boot/index.html>binarly.io</a></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious what happened, actually. The image parsers were written with the assumption they&rsquo;d only ever need to load an image file provided by the manufacturer. When this assumption was violated, all hell broke loose, because <a href=https://davidkcaudill.medium.com/maybe-getting-rid-of-your-qa-team-was-bad-actually-52c408bd048b>we don&rsquo;t test software anymore</a>. None of this happened because engineering is hard. None of this happened because of some tricky, subtle bug. It happened because the people writing the image parsers made an incredibly stupid mistake and then didn&rsquo;t bother testing it, because the software industry doesn&rsquo;t bother with QA anymore. Thus, there was no <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model>swiss cheese</a>. There was just one slice of cheese with a gaping hole in it, because it turns out that some manufacturers decided to let users customize their boot image, thinking it would be harmless, and that by itself was enough to wreak havoc.</p><p>Every layer of this problem is a different flavor of coordination failure. No one on the team who implemented this either thought that there might need to be a warning about untrusted images, or whoever did bring it up was ignored because it was supposed to be handled by another team. Except whoever was supposed to put in a warning about this either wasn&rsquo;t told, or buried it inside a technical document nobody ever reads. The vendors who decided to implement user-customizable boot logos didn&rsquo;t ask whether this would be a problem, or weren&rsquo;t told about it.</p><p>And <em>nobody</em>, not a single layer in this clown train, <a href=https://davidkcaudill.medium.com/maybe-getting-rid-of-your-qa-team-was-bad-actually-52c408bd048b#5a65>implemented a proper QA or pentesting process</a> that could have caught this bug, because we just don&rsquo;t bother testing anything anymore. Our economic incentives have somehow managed to incentivize building the worst possible piece of shit that still technically works. We know how to avoid this situation. We have decades of experience building in-depth QA processes that we are simply ignoring. <strong>We could fix this, we just don&rsquo;t</strong>.</p><p>This is not exclusive to software, as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Limpr1L8Pss">fantastic video about the popcorn button</a> explains. Our economic race to the bottom has been sabotaging almost every aspect of engineering in our society. To save a few cents per microwave, the cheap microwaves don&rsquo;t include a humidity sensor and then lie about having a popcorn button when it can&rsquo;t actually work properly, which leads to everyone saying &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use the popcorn button&rdquo; and now nobody uses the popcorn buttons <em>even on microwaves that actually have a humidity sensor and a working popcorn button</em>. The cheapskates control the supply chain now. They have pissed in the proverbial pool, and if this sounds familiar, that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a classic example of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons>Tragedy of the Commons</a>.</p><p>Except, that&rsquo;s not an excuse. What&rsquo;s truly absurd is that the tragedy of the commons <em>isn&rsquo;t inevitable</em>. We <em>know</em> this because ancient human tribes managed to navigate responsible utilization of common resources <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Non-governmental_solution>all the time</a>. It has no historical basis whatsoever. The tragedy of the commons only happens when you have a total failure of collective action. It is the original symptom of societal enshittification.</p><blockquote>[...] many nomadic pastoralist societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact "balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound", reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit...</blockquote><p>We actually have a cure for blood cancer now, by the way. Like, <a href=https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2023/august/an-immunotherapy-strategy-against-all-blood-cancers>we&rsquo;ve done it</a>. It&rsquo;s likely that a similar form of immunotherapy will generalize to most forms of cancer. Unfortunately, the only approved gene therapy we have is for sickle-cell disease and <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03590-6>costs $2 million per patient</a>, so most people in America simply assume they will never be able to afford any of these treatments, even if they were dying of cancer, because insurance will never cover it. This is actually really bad, because if nobody can afford the treatment, then biotech companies won&rsquo;t bother investing into it, because it&rsquo;s not profitable! We have built a society that <em>can&rsquo;t properly incentivize</em> <em><strong>CURING CANCER</strong></em>. This is despite the fact that socialized healthcare is a proven effective strategy (as long as the government <a href=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-crisis-covid-privatisation-funding-b2255741.html>doesn&rsquo;t sabotage it</a>). <strong>We could fix this, we just don&rsquo;t</strong>.</p><p>Some people try to complain that this happens because democracy is hard, or whatever, and they&rsquo;re also wrong. <em>We know exactly what&rsquo;s wrong with our current voting systems</em> and CGP Grey even put out a video on it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo">13 fucking years ago</a>. It <em>inevitably</em> results in a two-party system, because strategic voting is rational behavior, and you can&rsquo;t break out of this two-party system because of the spoiler effect, and the solution is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE">Ranked Choice Voting</a> (or the Alternative Vote). If you want to go further and address gerrymandering you can use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI">Single Transferable Vote</a>. All of these better systems were proposed decades ago. We have implemented exactly none of them for the presidential election (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States>except for Maine and Alaska</a>). In fact, America still uses the electoral vote system, which is strictly worse than the popular vote, we all know it&rsquo;s worse, and we even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUX-frlNBJY">have a potential solution</a> but we still can&rsquo;t get rid of it due to counterproductive societal interests.</p><p>We <em>HAVE</em> solutions for these problems. We just don&rsquo;t use them. We <em>could</em> be running fiber-optic cable to every house in America, and we even know how much it would cost. We just don&rsquo;t because we gave the money to corporations who then <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/comment/dhsxq6k/>used none of it and instead paid themselves huge bonuses</a>. We <em>know</em> that automation is chipping away at low-skill jobs, which means our workforce needs to be better educated, and that providing free college to everyone would be a good idea, we just don&rsquo;t. We know how to build interstate high-speed commuter rail, we just don&rsquo;t (although <a href=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-billions-to-deliver-world-class-high-speed-rail-and-launch-new-passenger-rail-corridors-across-the-country/>Biden is trying</a>). <strong>We could fix everything, we just don&rsquo;t</strong>.</p><p>We have no excuses anymore. None of these are novel or difficult problems, not even the tragedy of the commons. We can do better. We don&rsquo;t need AI to fix things. We don&rsquo;t need new technology to solve these problems. We <em>already know how to do better</em>, we&rsquo;ve just dug ourselves into a cooperation slump that&rsquo;s so bad we can&rsquo;t even implement solutions <em>we already know about</em>, let alone invent new ones. We&rsquo;re in this hole simply because society is run by people who are incentivized to sabotage cooperation in the name of profits. That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s January 1st of the new year, and with all these people wishing each other a &ldquo;better year&rdquo;, I am here to remind you that <strong>it will only get worse</strong> unless we <em>do something</em>. Society getting worse is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q118B_QdP2k">not something you are hallucinating</a>. It cannot be fixed by you biking to work, or winning the lottery. We are running on the fumes of our wild technological progress of the past 100 years, and our inability to build social systems that can cooperate will destroy civilization as we know it, unless we <strong>do something about it</strong>.</p><p>We live in what is perhaps the most critical turning point in all of human history, and we&rsquo;re on a ship that has drifted far off course. The rapid current of technology means that we are swept along faster and faster, making it exponentially harder to steer away from the icebergs ahead of us. We <em><strong>must</strong></em> address our coordination failures. We <em><strong>must</strong></em> build systems that foster better cooperation, or this century won&rsquo;t be a turning point for humanity, it will be the end of humanity.</p><blockquote>"All that would remain of us would be a thin layer in some future rock face.
