Combined with Hanlon&amp;rsquo;s Razor, we arrive at the inescapable conclusion that most problems are caused by incompetence. What&amp;rsquo;s particularly interesting is that the number of incompetent people in a system tends to increase the higher up you go. Part of this is due to the Peter Principle, where organizations promote employees until they become incompetent, but this happens in the first place because it becomes harder to measure competence&amp;rsquo; the longer it takes the effects of actions to be felt, and as a species we have no way of measuring long-term incompetence.</description></item><item><title>We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/</guid><description>[programmers frantically pulling cables out of the wall]

&amp;mdash; qntmyrrh (@qntm) November 24, 2023 I remember growing up with that same old adage of how you could be the next scientist to invent a cure for cancer, or a solution to climate change, or whatever. What they don&amp;rsquo;t tell you is that we already have solutions for a lot of problems, we just don&amp;rsquo;t use them.</description></item><item><title>People Can't Care About Everything</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 20:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/</guid><description>I originally posted an even more snarky response to this, but later deleted it when I realized they were just a teenager. Kids do not have decades of experience with buggy drivers, infuriating edge-cases, and broken promises necessary to understand and contribute to the underlying debate here (nor do they have the social context to know that Xe and I were just joking with each other). Of course, they also don&amp;rsquo;t know that it&amp;rsquo;s generally considered poor taste to interject like this, as it tends to annoy everyone and almost always fails to take into consideration the greater context in which someone might be using Windows, or Mac, or TikTok, or Twitter, or whatever corporate hellscape they are trapped in.</description></item><item><title>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 13:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/</guid><description>Discord&amp;rsquo;s Recent Announcement made a lot of people mad, mostly because of Hyrum&amp;rsquo;s Law - users were relying on unintended observable behavior in the original username system, and are mad that their use-cases are being broken despite very good evidence that the current system is problematic. I think the major issue here is that Discord didn&amp;rsquo;t go far enough, and as a result, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing users who are unaware of the technical and practical reasons for the username change, or what a username is even for.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/age-of-bullshit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/age-of-bullshit/</guid><description>We are fucked.
In fact, we are so fucked that Tom Scott conveniently released a new video talking about how fucked we are. Of course, he didn&amp;rsquo;t actually say that we&amp;rsquo;re fucked, because he&amp;rsquo;s much nicer than I am. He uses soft and gentle words that disguise the raging maelstrom beneath us. His video talks about how &amp;ldquo;everything is about to change&amp;rdquo;, and he&amp;rsquo;s right. I think he&amp;rsquo;s more right than he wants to be, he knows it, and he&amp;rsquo;s terrified.</description></item><item><title>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 14:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/</guid><description>Decades ago, something absolutely unheard of happened - a nerd became the richest person on the planet. This, of course, was merely a consequence of Software Eating The World, a fact we are all now painfully aware of. Programming, once delegated to glasses-wearing nerds banging away on strange boxey devices that could add numbers, has been transformed into something that many people are interested in (mostly because it makes tons of money).</description></item><item><title>Money Is Fake.

You just can&amp;rsquo;t.
We have finally left sanity behind, with nvidia&amp;rsquo;s 4000 series cards yielding a &amp;ldquo;clown car&amp;rdquo; of absurd GPU designs, as GamersNexus put it. These cards are so huge they need &amp;ldquo;GPU Support Sticks&amp;rdquo;, which are an actual real thing now. The fact that we insist on relegating the GPU to interfacing with the system while hanging off of a single, increasingly absurd PCIe 6.</description></item><item><title>I'll Never Respect My Elders After What They've Done</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/never-respect-my-elders-after-what-they-did/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 18:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/never-respect-my-elders-after-what-they-did/</guid><description>21 years ago, I walked into my 5th grade teacher&amp;rsquo;s classroom and it was dead silent. The TV was on. Something was happening that I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand, but my instincts told me that This Was Very Wrong. That moment is carved into my memory not because of what actually happened on September 11th, which I was too young to fully grasp, but because the way the adults were behaving signaled to my young mind that this was very important and I needed to remember it.</description></item><item><title>Camp Vista - Growing Up Next To Microsoft</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/camp-vista/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 22:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/camp-vista/</guid><description>This blog was started on LiveJournal shortly after I graduated high school in 2009. It has survived this long because I was very persistent about porting all my posts to Blogger, and then to my own static website. Of course, I have limits. Most of my terrible old posts were removed long ago, because they were so bad they didn&amp;rsquo;t contribute anything. One post was a rant about my high school internship at Microsoft.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain Is The New JavaScript</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/blockchain-new-javascript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 01:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/blockchain-new-javascript/</guid><description>Over 25 years ago, Brenden Eich created JavaScript, named after Java simply because it was popular. It&amp;rsquo;s prototypical nature and dynamic typing made it unsuitable for anything other than slow interpreters, forcing Google to invent a way to JIT the language just to make it fast. We even built a package manager for JavaScript which managed to create such an absurd dependency hell that one guy&amp;rsquo;s left-pad function managed to break web development for a day.</description></item><item><title>Kits And Pack Orphans First [Fiction]</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/offworld-pack-orphans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 01:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/offworld-pack-orphans/</guid><description>ALTERNATIVE TITLE: Offworld Pack Orphan
NOTES: The message delay is 8 minutes ROUND TRIP, that means the wormhole is 4 light minutes away, or 3.5 light minutes away from the L2 point. This means it takes 17.5 minutes at 20% speed of light, or 20 minutes at 17% the speed of light for the round to reach the station. Having it at the L2 point would also make aiming easier.</description></item><item><title>C++ Constructors, Memory, and Lifetimes</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/cpp-constructors-memory-and-lifetimes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 23:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/cpp-constructors-memory-and-lifetimes/</guid><description>What exactly happens when you write Foo* foo = new Foo();? A lot is packed into this one statement, so lets try to break it down. First, this example is allocating new memory on the heap, but in order to understand everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on, we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to explain what it means to declare a variable on the stack. If you already have a good understanding of how the stack works, and how functions do cleanup before returning, feel free to skip to the new statement.</description></item><item><title>Factorio Is The Best Technical Interview We Have</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/factorio-is-best-interview-we-have/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/factorio-is-best-interview-we-have/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of hand-wringing over The Technical Interview lately. Many people realize that inverting a binary tree on a whiteboard has basically zero correlation to whether or not someone is actually a good software developer. The most effective programming test anyone&amp;rsquo;s come up with is still Fizzbuzz. One consequence of this has been an increased emphasis on Open Source Contributions, but it turns out these aren&amp;rsquo;t a very good metric either, because most people don&amp;rsquo;t have that kind of time.</description></item><item><title>Why You Can't Use Prebuilt LLVM 10.0 with C++17</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 02:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17/</guid><description>C++17 introduced an alignment argument to ::operator new(). It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that if you allocate something using aligned new, you absolutely must deallocate it using aligned delete, or the behavior is undefined. LLVM 10.x takes advantage of this alignment parameter, if the compiler supports it. That means if you are compiling on Windows with MSVC set to C++14, __cpp_aligned_new is not defined and the extra argument isn&amp;rsquo;t passed. Otherwise, if it&amp;rsquo;s compiled with MSVC set to C++17, __cpp_aligned_new is defined and the extra argument is passed.</description></item><item><title>Someone Is Stealing Tracker Songs And Selling Them</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/someone-is-stealing-tracker-songs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2020 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/someone-is-stealing-tracker-songs/</guid><description>Today, in response to a tweet talking about old untitled song ideas, I mentioned that I had a strange file called &amp;ldquo;t.mp3&amp;rdquo; sitting in my downloads folder that had been there for years and have no attached metadata or hint as to where it came from. It appeared to be a complete recording of a chiptune song, and it sounded very nice, but I had no way of knowing the original source.</description></item><item><title>Pressure Based Anti-Spam for Discord Bots</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots/</guid><description>Back when Discord was a wee little chat platform with no rate limiting whatsoever, it&amp;rsquo;s API had already been reverse-engineered by a bunch of bot developers who then went around spamming random servers with so many messages it would crash the client. My friends and I were determined to keep our discord server public, so I went about creating the first anti-spam bot for Discord.
I am no longer maintaining this bot beyond simple bugfixes because I have better things to do with my time, and I&amp;rsquo;m tired of people trying to use it because &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s the best anti-spam bot&amp;rdquo; even after I deprecated it.</description></item><item><title>Name Shadowing Should Be An Operator</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/name-shadowing-should-be-an-operator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2019 13:23:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/name-shadowing-should-be-an-operator/</guid><description>I recently discovered that in Rust, this is a relatively common operation: let foo = String::from(&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;); // stuff that needs ownership let foo = &amp;amp;foo; Or this: let mut vec = Vec::new(); vec.push(&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;); vec.push(&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;); let vec = vec; /* vec is immutable now */ This is a particularly permissive form of name-shadowing, which allows you to re-declare a variable in an inner scope that shadows the name of a variable in an outer scope, making the outer variable inaccessible.</description></item><item><title>A Rant On Terra</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/a-rant-on-terra/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 17:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/a-rant-on-terra/</guid><description>Metaprogramming, or the ability to inspect, modify and generate code at compile-time (as opposed to reflection, which is runtime introspection of code), has slowly been gaining momentum. Programmers are finally admitting that, after accidentally inventing turing complete template systems, maybe we should just have proper first-class support for generating code. Rust has macros, Zig has built-in compile time expressions, Nim lets you rewrite the AST however you please, and dependent types have been cropping up all over the place.</description></item><item><title>RISC Is Fundamentally Unscalable</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/risc-is-fundamentally-unscalable/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2019 20:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/risc-is-fundamentally-unscalable/</guid><description>Today, there was an announcement about a new RISC-V chip, which has got a lot of people excited. I wish I could also be excited, but to me, this is just a reminder that RISC architectures are fundamentally unscalable, and inevitably stop being RISC as soon as they need to be fast. People still call ARM a &amp;ldquo;RISC&amp;rdquo; architecture despite ARMv8.3-A adding a FJCVTZS instruction, which is &amp;ldquo;Floating-point Javascript Convert to Signed fixed-point, rounding toward Zero&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Software Engineering Is Bad, But That's Not Why</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/software-engineering-is-bad-but-it-s-not-that-bad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 11:03:49 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/software-engineering-is-bad-but-it-s-not-that-bad/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code for over 12 years, and for a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been disgusted by the sorry state of programming. That&amp;rsquo;s why I felt a deep kinship with Nikita Prokopov&amp;rsquo;s article, Software Disenchantment. It captures the intense feeling of frustration I have with the software industry as a whole and the inability of modern programmers to write anything even remotely resembling efficient systems.
Unfortunately, much of it is wrong.</description></item><item><title>Why Do People Use The Wrong Email?</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-do-people-use-the-wrong-email-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2018 10:57:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-do-people-use-the-wrong-email-/</guid><description>Ever since 2013, I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently started getting registration e-mails in foreign languages from sites I definitely did not sign up for.
It started with Instagram, on which a bizarrely determined young boy from somewhere around Denmark was trying to register using my e-mail address. Instagram lets you remove an e-mail from an account, which is what I did, repeatedly, but the kid kept adding the non-functional e-mail back on to the account.</description></item><item><title>Software Optimizes to Single Points of Failure</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/software-optimizes-to-single-points-of-failure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2018 18:01:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/software-optimizes-to-single-points-of-failure/</guid><description>Whenever people talk about removing single points of failure, most of the suggestions involve &amp;ldquo;distributed systems&amp;rdquo; that are resilient to hardware failures. For software, we&amp;rsquo;ve invented code signing and smart contracts via blockchain to ensure the code we&amp;rsquo;re running is what we expected to run.
But none of these technologies can prevent a bug from taking down the entire system.
A lot of people point to Google being a single point of failure.</description></item><item><title>Migrating To A Static Blog</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/migrating-to-static-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 09:07:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/migrating-to-static-blog/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished constructing a new personal website for myself using hugo, and I&amp;rsquo;m moving my blog over there so I have more control over what gets loaded, and more importantly, so the page doesn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to load Blogger&amp;rsquo;s 5 MB worth of bloated javascript nonsense just to read some text.

As an applied mathematician whose coding involves plenty of multiplication, I was not happy to hear this. Nobody who does math actually memorizes times tables, and furthermore, forcing a child to memorize anything is probably the worst possible thing you can do in modern society. No one should memorize their times tables, they should learn how to calculate them.</description></item><item><title>Ignoring Outliers Creates Racist Algorithms</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ignoring-outliers-creates-racist/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ignoring-outliers-creates-racist/</guid><description>Have you built an algorithm that mostly works? Does it account for almost everyone&amp;rsquo;s needs, save for a few weird outliers that you ignore because they make up 0.0001% of the population? Congratulations, your algorithm is racist! To illustrate how this happens, let&amp;rsquo;s take a recent example from Facebook. My friend&amp;rsquo;s message was removed for &amp;ldquo;violating community standards&amp;rdquo;. Now, my friend has had all sorts of ridiculous problems with Facebook, so to test my theory, I posted the exact same message on my page, and then had him report it.</description></item><item><title>I Used To Want To Work For Google</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-used-to-want-to-work-for-google/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 01:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-used-to-want-to-work-for-google/</guid><description>A long time ago I thought Google was this magical company that truly cared about engineering and solving problems instead of maximizing shareholder value. Then Larry Page became CEO and I realized they were not a magical unicorn and lamented the fact that they had been transformed into &amp;ldquo;just another large company&amp;rdquo;. Several important things happened between that post and now: Microsoft got a new CEO, so I decided to give them a shot and got hired there.</description></item><item><title>Sexist Programmers Are Awful Engineers</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/sexist-programmers-are-awful-engineers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2017 12:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/sexist-programmers-are-awful-engineers/</guid><description>Men and women are fundamentally different. So are white people and black people and autistic people and gay people and transgender people and conservatives and liberals and every other human being along every imaginable axis of discrimination. Some of these differences are cultural. Others are genetic. Others depend on environmental factors. These differences mean that some of us are inherently better at certain tasks than others. On average, men are better at spatial temporal reasoning, women are better at reading comprehension and writing ability, and psychopaths can sometimes be excellent CEOs.</description></item><item><title>Why I Never Built My SoundCloud Killer</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-i-never-built-my-soundcloud-killer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 16:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-i-never-built-my-soundcloud-killer/</guid><description>While the news of SoundCloud imploding are fairly recent, musicians and producers have had a beef with the music uploading site&amp;rsquo;s direction for years. I still remember when SoundCloud only gave you a paltry 2 hours worth of free upload time and managed to convert my high quality lossless WAV files to the shittiest 128 kbps MP3 I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard in my life.

Every time I wind up having to resolve a dispute, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to get both sides of the story, only to realize that they&amp;rsquo;re the same story, and both parties were actually either in agreement or fighting over a perceived insult that never actually existed. Unsurprisingly, a disproportionate amount of this miscommunication often involves programmers being far too strict with their interpretations of what certain words mean.</description></item><item><title>Companies Can't Be Apolitical</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/companies-cant-be-apolitical/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 00:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/companies-cant-be-apolitical/</guid><description>One of the most common things I hear from people is that companies should be &amp;ldquo;apolitical&amp;rdquo;. The most formal way this concept is expressed is that a company should make decisions based on what maximizes profits and not political opinions. Unfortunately, the statement &amp;ldquo;companies should only care about maximizing profits&amp;rdquo; is, itself, a political statement (and one I happen to disagree with). Thus, it is fundamentally impossible for a company to be truly apolitical, for the very act of attempting to be apolitical is a political statement.</description></item><item><title>I Can't Hear Anything Below 80 Hz*</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-cant-hear-anything-below-80-hz/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 15:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-cant-hear-anything-below-80-hz/</guid><description>** at a comfortable listening volume.* EDIT: I have confirmed all the results presented here by taking the low frequency test with someone standing physically next to me.

This behavior can cause all sorts of mayhem, like your program just vanishing into thin air without any error messages due to a stack overflow that terminated the program without actually throwing an exception. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize is that it also eats assert(), which makes debugging hell, because the assertion would throw, the entire user callback would immediately terminate without any stack unwinding, and then windows would just&amp;hellip; keep going, even though the program is now in a laughably corrupt state, because only half the function executed.</description></item><item><title>DirectX Is Terrifying</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/directx-is-terrifying/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/directx-is-terrifying/</guid><description>About two months ago, I got a new laptop and proceeded to load all my projects on it. Despite compiling everything fine, my graphics engine that used DirectX mysteriously crashed upon running. I immediately suspected either a configuration issue or a driver issue, but this seemed weird because my laptop had a newer graphics card than my desktop. Why was it crashing on newer hardware? Things got even more bizarre once I narrowed down the issue - it was in my shader assignment code, which hadn&amp;rsquo;t been touched in almost 2 years.</description></item><item><title>Our Software Is a Beacon of Hope</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/our-software-is-beacon-of-hope/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2017 14:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/our-software-is-beacon-of-hope/</guid><description>As I draw closer to releasing the first early alpha of a library I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that it&amp;rsquo;s release time coincides with some rather depressing politics that I wish I could ignore.

All color values in CSS3 are in the sRGB color space, because that&amp;rsquo;s the color space that gets displayed on our monitor. However, the problem is that the sRGB color space looks like this:
Trying to do a linear interpolation along a nonlinear curve doesn&amp;rsquo;t work very well.

I pulled up my notes from college and was able to correctly calculate the standard deviation they had been unable to derive after hours upon hours of searching the internet and trying to piece together poor explanations from questionable sources.

We cannot control what people are saying or our democracy falls apart. On the other hand, allowing harassment has a stifling effect on free speech, because it allows people to be bullied into silence. Before the internet, this distinction was fairly simple: Someone with a megaphone screaming hate speech in a park is exercising their right to free speech.</description></item><item><title>There Will Never Be One True Programming Language</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/there-will-never-be-one-true/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 03:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/there-will-never-be-one-true/</guid><description>A disturbing number of otherwise intelligent programmers seem to believe that, one day in the distant future, everyone will use the same magical programming language that solves everyone&amp;rsquo;s problems at the same time.

If you are familiar with C#, you should be familiar with the difference between C#&amp;rsquo;s struct and class declarations. Namely, a struct is a value type and a class is a reference type, meaning that if you pass a struct to a function, its default behavior is for the entire struct to be copied into the function&amp;rsquo;s parameter, so any modifications made to it won&amp;rsquo;t affect whatever was passed in.</description></item><item><title>7 Problems Raytracing Doesn't Solve</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/7-problems-raytracing-doesnt-solve/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2012 04:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/7-problems-raytracing-doesnt-solve/</guid><description>I see a lot of people get excited about extreme concurrency in modern hardware bringing us closer to the magical holy grail of raytracing.

You will forget this semicolon, and then all the things will break.

This tutorial will assume you have a fairly strong grasp of C#, but may not be familiar with some of its more arcane attributes.</description></item><item><title>On Hacking (or Why We Need Security Ratings)</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/on-hackers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2011 17:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/on-hackers/</guid><description>Another website has been hacked. It seems almost routine now, with site after site getting demolished by hackers. The overwhelming public response to the catastrophe has been to ask, &amp;ldquo;can anything be made secure?&amp;rdquo; Security experts, naturally, are constantly attacking the companies in question for their dismal security practices, but what of the general public? They don&amp;rsquo;t know what a hash is. They don&amp;rsquo;t know what an SQL injection is. They have no reason to know these things and will never understand them.</description></item><item><title>My Mom Had a Heart Attack</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/my-mom-had-heart-attack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2011 01:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/my-mom-had-heart-attack/</guid><description>She is fine and will make a full recovery.
About 3 weeks ago, on Thursday, May 19th, at approximately 6 PM, my mom went into ventricular fibrillation and collapsed while walking on a nearby trail. She was found by two walkers who called 911 and initiated CPR. After almost a half hour of CPR and 3 defibrillator attempts, she was stabilized and taken to the nearby hospital. She had no identification, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t know about it until after 2 hours of failed searching, at which point my dad called the local hospital.</description></item><item><title>The Religion Problem: Perspectives</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/religion-problem-perspectives/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2011 06:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/religion-problem-perspectives/</guid><description>I view religion as a symptom of humanity&amp;rsquo;s inability to operate as a rational agent. This statement will usually validate itself by being misinterpreted as an attack on religion, despite the statement itself simply stating that religion is irrational, not that it is a bad thing. Furthermore, we don&amp;rsquo;t know if irrationality is inherently bad or worse than rationality, although humanity in general seems to prefer thinking of itself as rational despite repeatedly acting in completely irrational ways, usually without knowing it.</description></item><item><title>The Ninth Circle of Bugs</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ninth-circle-of-bugs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2011 04:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ninth-circle-of-bugs/</guid><description>So I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting my 2D culling kd-tree for my graphics engine, and a strange bug pops up. On release mode, one of the images vanished. Since it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen in debug mode, it was already a heisenbug. A heisenbug is defined as a bug that vanishes when you try to find it. It took me almost a day to trace the bug to the rebalance function. At first I thought the image had simply been removed from a node accidentally, but this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case.</description></item><item><title>Save RSS</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/save-rss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2011 22:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/save-rss/</guid><description>A recent article by Jesse Stay describes how Twitter and Facebook are killing RSS. Many people point out that you don&amp;rsquo;t really need an RSS feed for either service, since the content they generate is not particularly conducive to an RSS feed. While this is strictly true if you are attempting to read the actual RSS feed, I don&amp;rsquo;t consider this the primary benefit of an RSS feed.
RSS feeds provide a way to broadcast data in a standard format, which then allows an application to be quickly constructed using an RSS parser to process that data.</description></item><item><title>College Is Broken</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/college-is-broken/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2011 21:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/college-is-broken/</guid><description>The reason I have been repeatedly rejected from the computer science major at my college is partly due to underfunded and crowded conditions, but primarily because they are letting in the wrong students. Apparently, had I gotten a 3.5 in all of my classes, I would have been in the major already. Because I instead got a 4.0 in one class and a 3.0 in another, they have rejected me. Why?</description></item><item><title>An Outside Perspective on the PSN Fiasco</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/outside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2011 21:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/outside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco/</guid><description>I asked a non-technical friend of mine, who has been unable to play online with his PS3 recently due to the PSN outage, what he thought about practically all of his personal information being compromised due to an intrusion and questionable security. His perspective is not what I was expecting.
I'm just saying, they've been the target of hackers already, it just takes a couple members of Anonymous doing their own thing to get back in I imagine.</description></item><item><title>Future Predictions</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/future-predictions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2011 15:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/future-predictions/</guid><description>In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve made several predictions that were dismissed, at the time, as ludicrous, but have in fact come to fruition, like the importance of having dynamic environments in games and graphics engines that can handle it. So, here I present a complete list of all the computer-related or economic predictions I currently have, along with justification:
Speed becomes paramount to all mature markets: People have been ignoring speed for as long as they can, because its apparently rather difficult for programmers to properly optimize programs.</description></item><item><title>Investigating Low-level CPU Performance</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/investigating-low-level-cpu-performance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2011 17:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/investigating-low-level-cpu-performance/</guid><description>While reconstructing my threaded Red-Black tree data structure, I naturally assumed that due to invalid branch predictions costing significant amounts of performance, by eliminating branching in low-level data structures, one can significant enhance the performance of your application. I did some profiling and was stunned to discover that my new, optimized Red Black tree was&amp;hellip; SLOWER then the old one! This can&amp;rsquo;t be right, I eliminated several branches and streamlined the whole thing, how can it be SLOWER?</description></item><item><title>The Bullying Never Stops</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/bullying-never-stops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2011 14:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/bullying-never-stops/</guid><description>I believe that at a young age, I was physically harassed a couple of times, but I have long since forgotten. What I haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten is the intellectual bullying I was subjected to during 7th grade. There is not a day that goes by that my actions are not subtly influenced by when I misprounced &amp;ldquo;subtle&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;sub&amp;rdquo;-&amp;ldquo;tle&amp;rdquo; and was made a laughingstock in front of my honors class, several of whom told me that I was a hopeless idiot who couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything right.</description></item><item><title>The IM Failure</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/im-failure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2010 03:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/im-failure/</guid><description>This is completely insane. First, Microsoft has rendered its new Windows Live Messenger (previously MSN messenger) almost completely useless.
No more handwriting No more setting your name to anything other then your first and last name. All links you click on redirect you to a page from Microsoft warning you about the dangers of the internet, requiring you to click a link to proceed. All photosharing is now incompatible with previous versions of messenger, and instead of actually just sending the file, it will instead fail completely.</description></item><item><title>How To Train Your Dragon</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-to-train-your-dragon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2010 04:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-to-train-your-dragon/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;takes its place as one of my favorite movies of all time. The characters are brilliant, the story is superb, the music is divine, and the cinematography is breathtaking. It was so good it gave me the last bit of inspiration I needed to make this (WIP), and as a result my attempts at finishing CEGUI this weekend were thrown out the window. Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll try a first draft of the drums and possible a couple of effects before extending the main chorus.</description></item><item><title>Album For Sale!

My friend has a large collection of wavs that somehow got corrupted, so I wrote this program to strip them of all metadata. Due to the nature of the bug, the program can&amp;rsquo;t delete them (you must use the command prompt to do that), but rather creates a folder called &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; with all the stripped wav files inside of it.</description></item><item><title>Pixel Perfect Hit Testing</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pixel-perfect-hit-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2010 06:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pixel-perfect-hit-testing/</guid><description>After beating World of Goo after stabilizing things in my game and renaming it, I wondered how easy it was to decompile C# applications and simultaneously thought this would be a great opportunity to get pixel perfect hit testing to work on my engine.

I immediately wanted to implement it in my graphics engine, but soon realized that the technique is so damn old that no modern graphics card supports it anymore. So, I have come up with a pixel shader that creates the same functionality, either by having one image with an alpha channel containing the palette indices and a separate texture acting as the palette, or you can combine them into a single image.</description></item><item><title>Physics Networking</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-networking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2010 04:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-networking/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m still working on integrating physics into my game, but at some point here I am going to hit on that one major hurdle: syncing one physics environment with another that could be halfway across the globe.

if(!(rand()%2d)) footest.nothing(); else footest.nothing2(); is slightly faster then
(footest.*funcptr[rand()%2])(); where funcptr is an array of the possible function calls. I had suspected this after I looked at the assembly, and a basic function pointer call like that takes around 11 instructions whereas a normal function call takes a single instruction.</description></item><item><title>Most Bizarre Error Ever</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/most-bizarre-error-ever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2010 00:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/most-bizarre-error-ever/</guid><description>Ok probably not the most bizarre error ever but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely the weirdest for me.
My graphics engine has a Debug, a Release, and a special Release STD version that&amp;rsquo;s compatible with CLI function requirements and other dependencies. These are organized as 3 separate configurations in my solution for compiling. Pretty normal stuff.
My example applications are all set to be dependent on the graphics engine project, which means visual studio automatically compiles the proper lib file into the project.</description></item><item><title>Floating Point Preformance</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/floating-point-preformance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2010 01:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/floating-point-preformance/</guid><description>Whenever I do intensive performance testing on delicate math operations, the results almost always surprise me.

It&amp;rsquo;s actually extraordinarily difficult and is almost completely reliant on the quality of interpolation. Due to the nature of interpolation, it gets exponentially more inaccurate the more time is spent doing it. Therefore, a game designer should want to minimize the amount needed. This is not an easy task, but it usually involves using the server as a middleman to halve the interpolation time.</description></item><item><title>Proving Strong AI</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/proving-strong-ai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2009 23:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/proving-strong-ai/</guid><description>I stumped my philosophy professor today. We were discussing the Chinese Room Thought Experiment and how it proves that a Strong AI is impossible (a strong AI being a thinking machine).
