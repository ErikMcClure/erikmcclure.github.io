They are. I still use their products, mostly because I don't put things on the internet I don't want other people to find, and I'm not female, so I don't have to worry about misogynists stalking me. They still make stupendous amounts of money and pump out some genuinely good software. They still have the best search engine. Like Microsoft, they'll be a force to be reckoned with for many decades to come.</p><p>Google, however, represented an <em>ideal</em>. They founded the company with the motto &ldquo;Don't Be Evil&rdquo;, and the unspoken question was, how long would this last? The answer, oddly enough, was &ldquo;until Larry Page took over&rdquo;.</p><p>In its early years, Google unleashed the creativity of the brilliant people it hired to the world and came up with a slew of fantastic products that were a joy to use. Google made huge contributions to the open-source world and solved scalability problems with an elegance that has yet to be surpassed. They famously let engineers use 20% of their time to pursue their own interests, and the result was an unstoppable tidal wave of innovation. Google was, for a brief moment, a shining beacon of hope, a force of good in a bleak world of corporations only concerned with maximizing profit.</p><p>Then Larry Page became CEO. Larry Page worshiped Steve Jobs, who gave him <a href=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-steve-jobs-influenced-googles.html>a bunch of bad advice</a> centered around <em>maximizing profit</em>. The result was predictable and catastrophic, as the entire basis of what had made Google so innovative was destroyed for the sake of <em>maximizing profit</em>. Now it's just another large company - only concerned about <em>maximizing profit</em>.</p><p>Google was a company that, for a time, I loved. To me, they represented the antithesis of Microsoft, a rebellion against a poisonous corporate culture dominated by profiteering that had no regard for its users. Google was just a bunch of really smart people trying to make the world a better place, and for a precious few years, they succeeded - until it all came tumbling down. Like an artist whose idol has become embroiled in a drug abuse scandal, I have lost my guiding light.</p><p>Google was largely the reason I wanted to start my own company, even if college kept me from doing so. As startup culture continued to suck the life out of silicon valley, I held on to Google as an ideal, an example of the kind of company I wanted to build instead of a site designed to sort cat photos. A company that made money because it solved real problems better than everyone else. A company that respected good programming practices, using the right tool for the job, and the value of actually <em>solving</em> a problem instead of just throwing more code at it.</p><p>Google was a company that solved problems first, and made money second.</p><p>Now, it has succumbed to maximizing stock price for a bunch of rich wall street investors who don't care about anything other than filling their own pockets with as much cash as they possibly can. Once again, the rest of the world is forced to sit around, waiting until an investor accidentally makes the world a better place in the process of trying to make as much money as possible.</p><p>Most people think this is the only way to get things done. For a precious few years, I could point to Google and say otherwise. Now, it has collapsed, and its collapse has made me doubt my own resolve. If Google, of all companies, couldn't maintain that idealistic vision, was it even <em>possible?</em></p><p>Google gave me a reason to believe that humanity could do better. That we could move past a Wall Street that has become nothing more than a rotting cesspool of greed and corruption.</p><p>Now, Google has fallen, along with the ideal it encompassed. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Or is it a train, a force of reality come to remind us that no matter how much we reach for utopia, we will be sentenced to drown in our own greed?</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-11-17T11:13:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/>November 17, 2013 at 11:13am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;38 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fgoogles-decline-really-bugs-me%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Google%27s%20Decline%20Really%20Bugs%20Me&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fgoogles-decline-really-bugs-me%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fgoogles-decline-really-bugs-me%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fgoogles-decline-really-bugs-me%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/the-educational-imbroglio/>The Educational Imbroglio</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>The most recent and perhaps egregious example of this is a breathtakingly misguided <a href=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/educationlab/2013/10/27/roundtable-can-tracking-ever-work/#2>article by Kevin G. Welner</a>, who is the director of the National Education Policy center, which is absolutely terrifying. He is attempting to discredit the idea of &ldquo;tracking&rdquo;, wherein low-performing students are separated from higher achieving students, because obviously you can't teach kids who &ldquo;get it&rdquo; the same way as kids who are struggling. Unfortunately, the entire conclusion rests on a logical fallacy. He says, and I quote:</p><p>There's also a persistent argument against charter schools, which claims that the money spent on charter schools should instead be used to improve public schools instead. This is laughable, because public schools receive funding based on test scores. So, all the money would be spent improving test scores instead of actually teaching children anything. Charter schools are important because they aren't bounded by these nonsensical restrictions and thus are free to experiment with alternative teaching styles. Throwing money at our public schools will only shore up a method of teaching that's fundamentally broken. It's like trying to fix the plumbing after the roof caved in - it's completely missing the point.</p><p>To make matters worse, there's also a war on free time. Recess is being cut in favor of increased instruction time, while educators cite minuscule increases in test scores as proof that this &ldquo;works&rdquo;. If by &ldquo;works&rdquo;, you mean it succeeds in cramming more useless junk into kids heads, then sure, it's &ldquo;working&rdquo;. However, if you want kids to actually <em>learn</em> instead of memorize pointless facts that they will immediately forget, you have to give them time to <em>process concepts</em>. Their brains need <em>rest</em>, not more work. Bodybuilders don't lift weights as long as they can every single day; they lift weights <em>every other day</em> and only for a few hours or so, because the muscle needs time to recover.</p><p>This, however, is an issue with a society that thinks hard work means working yourself to exhaustion. This is incredibly short-sighted and in direct opposition to plenty of evidence that points to rest being a necessary part of a healthy lifestyle. It can be your job, or school, or a hobby, it doesn't matter. Humans do not function effectively when forced to focus on one thing for hours at a time. The only reason we attempt to do this is because we used to work in factories, but nowadays we have robots. Modern jobs are all about <em>thinking creatively</em>, which cannot be forced. You can't force yourself to understand a concept. It's like trying to force a broken leg to heal faster by going for a jog. You <em>must</em> give kids time absorb concepts instead of trying to cram it down their throats. They need to <em>understand</em> what they are learning, not memorize formulas.</p><p>Mainstream education doesn't take this seriously. There are plenty of experiments that have effectively taught children advanced concepts with radically different teaching methods. One guy <a href=http://www.garlikov.com/Soc_Meth.html>taught 3rd graders binary</a>. <a href=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/27/opinion/ted-prize-students-teach-themselves/index.html>These kids</a> learned english and how to operate a computer <em>without a teacher at all</em>. There are plenty of cases that show just how woefully inadequate our teaching system is, but it seems that we care more about a one-size-fits-all method that can be mass-produced than a method that's actually effective.</p><p>Our educational system is failing our students, and we refuse to even entertain notions that could make a difference. Instead, we just legislate more tests and take away their recess.</p><p>Because really, memorizing the date of the Battle of Gettysburg is more important than playing outside and <em>having a childhood</em>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-10-29T19:58:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-educational-imbroglio/>October 29, 2013 at 7:58pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/the-educational-imbroglio/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;3 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-educational-imbroglio%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Educational%20Imbroglio%20%20&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-educational-imbroglio%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-educational-imbroglio%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-educational-imbroglio%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/the-ladder-climbing-generation/>The Ladder-Climbing Generation</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.*</p><p>  — Bill Watterson, 1990 speech at Kenyon College</p><p>Someone, once again, is complaining about those misbehaving youngsters <a href=http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/08/12/hard-work/>who don't understand the value of hard work</a>. He lampoons the advice to follow your passion, saying that young people are just scared of hard work. He makes the dangerously misinformed claim that burn-out is just a myth: <em>&ldquo;Burn out is just a rationalization for giving up early."</em></p><p>For someone who seems so sure of what they're talking about, it would be difficult for him to be more wrong. Following your passion doesn't mean you do less work. It doesn't even mean you'll avoid doing boring things. A standard 9-5 job doesn't require you to think. You drive to work, get told what to do by some guy in a suit for 8 hours, then go home. It's about following instructions, not actually doing anything <em>difficult</em>. Most programmers are lucky, and have plenty of employers who give them interesting problems to work on. In fact, for calling his post &ldquo;The Hacker News Generation&rdquo;, he doesn't seem to understand his audience very well. One of the current talking points is startups <em>overworking</em> their employees by expecting 80 hour work weeks, and how employees are trained to think this is ok.</p><p>That kind of seems like the <em>exact opposite</em> of an aversion to hard work.</p><p>Following your passion is immeasurably more difficult than climbing a corporate ladder. You usually work more hours for less pay, and often have to struggle to make ends meet. You have to do every part of your job, including all the mind-numbingly boring stuff, because <em>there isn't anyone else to do it</em>. People who are following their passion enjoy it more because they're doing something that's <em>important to them</em>, not because they're doing less work. An artist is the one drawing constantly, every day, barely making enough money to feed themselves. The guy at Microsoft writes a bunch of test code, checks it in, then gets lunch at the cafeteria. Where does this glorification of doing boring, repetitive tasks come from?</p><p>These people are busy climbing a ladder that society has put in front of them. They look out and see someone running around on the ground, away from the ladder, and become convinced they are hopelessly lost. Clearly, they don't understand the value of ladder climbing. When they realize that other people don't <em>care</em> about the ladder, they immediately conclude that these people don't understand what's important, because the only success they know of is the success they were promised by society at the top of the ladder.</p><p>A human being's worth cannot be measured in dollars or promotions. To follow one's dreams is not an act of cowardice, but rather one of incredible courage. To resist taking the easy way out, to avoid the routine of a 9-5 job, is to accept a life that is often filled with failure and hardship. The difference is that it will be a life worth living.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-10-03T15:10:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-ladder-climbing-generation/>October 3, 2013 at 3:10pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/the-ladder-climbing-generation/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;1 comment</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-ladder-climbing-generation%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Ladder-Climbing%20Generation&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-ladder-climbing-generation%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-ladder-climbing-generation%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-ladder-climbing-generation%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/the-microsoft-word-problem/>The Microsoft Word Problem</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>I use FL Studio 11 to make my music. Some people find this surprising, due to FL Studio's stigma as being a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; DAW that it simply cannot seem to shake, despite the fact it actually does most things as well or better than other professional DAWs. FL Studio has two real, significant issues: Large projects are unstable, and it has extremely bad 64-bit support.</p><p>This is almost never what people actually complain about. Instead, people complain about FL studio lacking features when they really just need to enable the right option. My friend lamented FL Studio's poor handling of automation clips without knowing about the &ldquo;browse parameters&rdquo; feature that lists all of a synth's parameters and highlights the one you are changing. He then complained that it didn't play notes when you started playback in the middle of them - this can be toggled in the audio settings. He also didn't know how to group multiple instruments to be controlled by the same piano roll, so I had to show him how to use Layers. Every single reason he gave for FL Studio being crap was just him not understanding how to use it properly, or not knowing where to find a specific feature.</p><p>This is the <em>exact same problem</em> Microsoft had with Word, and it's what resulted in the Ribbon GUI overhaul. Every reason people gave for not liking Word was just a result of them not being able to find the feature they wanted in an endless cascade of menus. To address this, it required a GUI overhaul so those features were grouped in intuitive ways, so people could find them more easily.</p><p>Even APIs can suffer from the Microsoft Word Problem. OpenGL, especially it's early incarnations, was essentially a giant, opaque list of functions that randomly referenced each other and had no clear organization. The <a href=http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/>online documentation</a> is literally just an alphabetized list of every single OpenGL function in existence. The end result is that you need to know precisely what you want to do in order to find the right function. This is in contrast to DirectX, which (for example) has every single renderstate in a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb172599(v=vs.85).aspx">single, enormous enumerator</a>. That enumerator contains something like 50 or so equivalent OpenGL function calls, which are not grouped in any meaningful way. It's documentation, like everything else on MSDN, is organized in hierarchical groups. DirectX tells you every single possible thing you theoretically might be able to do with your graphics card. OpenGL, on the other hand, has extensions, which are both a blessing and a curse. It makes OpenGL inherently more adaptable than DirectX, but at the cost of having absolutely no idea what the graphics card may or may not be capable of, because it's just <em>not in OpenGL</em>, it's in some extension you have to dig up.</p><p>Just like Microsoft Word, the features are all there in OpenGL, they're just harder to get to. And you'd better hope you know exactly what your technique is called, or you'll never find the function you want. WebGL inherits this problem, and throws on a few of its own inherent with attempting to bolt a low-level C api on to a high level web language that needs to be sandboxed.</p><p>We can't simply implement a feature, we have to make it easy to find, and easy to use, or it's worthless. It's amazing how quickly programmers forget the importance of <em>context</em>. In all of these cases, the solution to feature overload is conceptually very similar - Word created the Ribbon, which grouped related features under tabs and sub-groups. A similar grouping of OpenGL functions and parameters would do wonders for it's usability. FL Studio would also benefit by dumping it's left-hand browsing bar in favor of a Ribbon or module approach that didn't force 15 wildly different GUI styles into a single menu.</p><p>Context is important. If I want to find the function that sets the alpha blending operation in OpenGL, I should not have to go through over 300 functions to find it. I should be able to go to the &ldquo;sampling&rdquo; functions and look in the &ldquo;blending&rdquo; subgroup, and poof, all the functions that have anything to do with blending are there. It doesn't matter if we're designing word processors, digital audio workstations, low level APIs, middleware, or web applications. Anything and everything is susceptible to the Microsoft Word Problem.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-09-18T22:34:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-microsoft-word-problem/>September 18, 2013 at 10:34pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/the-microsoft-word-problem/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;1 comment</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-microsoft-word-problem%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Microsoft%20Word%20Problem%20&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-microsoft-word-problem%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-microsoft-word-problem%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-microsoft-word-problem%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/write-less-code/>Write Less Code</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>The burgeoning complexity of software is perhaps one of the most persistent problems plaguing computer science. We have tried many, many ways of managing this complexity: inventing new languages, creating management systems, and enforcing coding styles. They have all proven to be nothing more than stopgaps. With the revelation that the NSA is utilizing the inherent complexity of software systems to sabotage our efforts at securing our systems, this problem has become even more urgent.</p><p>It's easy to solve a problem with a lot of code - it's hard to solve a problem with a little code. Since most businesses do not understand the advantage of having high quality software, the most popular method of managing complexity is not to reduce how much code is used, but to wrap it up in a self-contained library so we can ignore it, instead. The problem with this approach is that you haven't gotten rid of the code. It's still there, it's just easier to ignore.</p><p>Until it breaks, that is. After we have wrapped complex systems into easy-to-use APIs, we then build even more complex systems on top of them, creating networks of interconnected components, each one encapsulating it's own complex system. Instead of addressing this burgeoning complexity, we simply wrap it into <em>another</em> API and pave over it, much like one would pave over a landfill. When it finally breaks, we have to <a href="http://ptrthomas.files.wordpress.com/2006/06/jtrac-callstack1.png?w=630">extract a core sample</a> just to get an idea of what might be going wrong.</p><p>One of the greatest contributions functional programming has made is its concept of a pure function with no side-effects. When a function has side effects, it's another edge on the graph of components where something could go wrong. Unfortunately, this isn't enough. If you simply replace a large complex system with a bunch of large complex functions that technically have no side-effects, it's still a large complex system.</p><p>Object-oriented programming tries to manage complexity by compartmentalizing things and (in theory) limiting how they interact with each other. This is designed to address spaghetti code that has a bunch of inter-dependent functions that are impossible to effectively debug. The OO paradigm has the right idea: &ldquo;an object should do exactly one thing, and do it well&rdquo;, but suffers from over-application. OO programming was designed to manage <em>very large complex objects</em>, not concepts that don't need Get/Set functions for every class member. Writing these functions <em>just in case</em> you need them in the future is a case of future-proofing, which should almost always be avoided. If there's an elegant, simple way to express a solution that only works given the constraints you currently have, <em><strong>USE IT</strong></em>. We don't need any more <a href=http://limejuice.fastmail.fm/expand-all-example.png>leaning towers of inheritance</a>.</p><p>The number of bugs in a software program is proportional to how much code you write, and that doesn't include cheap tricks like the ternary operator or importing a bunch of huge libraries. The logic is still there, the complexity is still there, and it will still break in mysterious ways. In order to reduce the complexity in our software, it has to do <em>less stuff</em>. The less code you write, the harder it is for the NSA to sabotage your program without anyone noticing. The less code you write, the fewer points of failure your program will have. The less code you write, the less stuff will break. We cannot hide from complexity any longer; we must actively reduce it. We have to begin excavating the landfill instead of paving over it.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-09-12T10:36:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o
