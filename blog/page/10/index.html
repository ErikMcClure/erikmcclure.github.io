My favorite movie of all time is actually [Contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(film)).<p>Many people assume the message behind Contact is that Religion and Science aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive, but this is only part of the equation. Contact is really about <em>faith</em>. It&rsquo;s about never losing faith in your own passion, regardless of what it is. It can be science, religion, art, music, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. All that matters is that you find your passion, and you have faith in it, and no matter what happens, no matter what stands in your way, you fight for it.</p><p>Naturally, in real life, we don&rsquo;t have a Dues Ex Hadden Industries to magic away all our problems, but the movie does an excellent job of making sure the drama that plays out on screen does not undermine it&rsquo;s purpose. Even with virtually unlimited funding, Ellie finds out she&rsquo;s being forcefully kicked out of the Very Large Array. No matter what anyone says to her, she refuses to let it go. At that point in the movie, it is abundantly clear that absolutely nothing will stop this woman from pursuing her passion, no matter how insane or misunderstood it is, no matter what obstacles are put in her path, no matter what friends she may lose along the way. At this darkest hour, after everything seems to be falling apart, she goes to a cliffside to think.</p><p>And then she comes back.</p><p>She comes back, and she starts listening again, because she isn&rsquo;t going to give up, and <em>that</em> is when she hears the signal. <em>That</em> is when our hollywood movie is yanked out of reality and brings us on a fantastic journey through the stars. It happens after Ellie <strong>refuses to give up</strong>, even after the universe itself seems to be conspiring to ruin her.</p><p>Then, the project is stolen from her repeatedly, and she has to fight to keep it. Then, she is denied her desire to be the one to ride through the machine. Then the machine is completely destroyed and everything she fought for is taken away from her.</p><p><em>Then</em>, our little Dues Ex Hadden comes back. Hadden gave Ellie her funding because of her emotional outburst at the investor meeting. Hadden saw the passion she had, the unstoppable fire and unshakable <em>faith</em> she had in her science project, and <em>that</em> is when he decided to fund her. Once again, Hadden moves us into the realm of fiction, and gives Ellie a second chance.</p><p>Contact is brilliant because it begins firmly anchored in reality, and only later, with a few nudges in the right direction, throws us into a world of make-believe. Carl Sagan is trying to make us ask, what if? What if we could fly? What if we could go to the moon? What if we colonized Mars? What if aliens contacted us? Contact shows us how beautiful life can be. It reminds us of all the amazing things that human beings are capable of when we ask that simple question, <em>What If?</em></br></br>To answer it, we just need a little faith.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-05-16T04:46:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/contact/>May 16, 2013 at 4:46am</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/contact/#commento> comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcontact%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Contact&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcontact%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcontact%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/the-dark-side-of-htmlcss/>The Dark Side of Web Development</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>I am, by no means, a very good web developer. I am, however, a highly experienced C++ developer. The end result is that people usually ask me why I like C++ so much when everyone else hates it, and everyone is supposedly in agreement that C++ is the worst language ever made and unless you are writing drivers you should never, ever use it. I mean, you can write games in Python now, right?</p><p>While these kinds of ignorant opinions are frustrating for me and my fellow C++ developers who actually need efficient cross-platform programs, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m here to debate. In fact, if you think C++ is a complete piece of shit, I won&rsquo;t argue with you about that at all. For all I know, you may be right!</p><p>Unfortunately for you, <strong>web development is just as bad as C++</strong>.</p><p>Of course, I just said that I&rsquo;m not very good at web development, so doesn&rsquo;t this disqualify me from having an opinion about it? On the contrary, the fact that I&rsquo;m not very good at web development is extremely important. The reason is that one of the major complaints about C++ is that <em>good C++ code is hard to write if you are an inexperienced developer</em>. I can certainly attest to that fact, it&rsquo;s taken me years to develop my C++ skills to this point. The fact that Python code is so easy and natural to write is one of its major selling points.</p><p>The thing is, <em>good HTML/CSS code is also hard to write if you are an inexperienced developer</em>. I can attest to this too, because I&rsquo;m an inexperienced developer, and its <em>really goddamn hard</em> to write good HTML/CSS code. Let me clarify what I mean by &ldquo;good&rdquo; here: by &ldquo;good&rdquo; I mean code that works on all platforms, doesn&rsquo;t blow up, and doesn&rsquo;t contain strange edge cases that will cause it to fail for no reason. Many developers preach the joys of functional programming, which eliminates most edge cases by prohibiting functions that have side-effects.</p><p>Everyone knows about the subtle, nasty bugs that can crop up in C++, often as a result of doing something that was intuitive, yet wrong. This is rehashed in the &ldquo;C++ is bad&rdquo; arguments over and over and over without end, <em>especially</em> with the functional programming zealots. The problem is that HTML/CSS has <em>all sorts of really stupid crap</em> that can happen when you do something subtly wrong with the HTML that is not immediately obvious to a new developer.</p><p>It took me a while to learn that you shouldn&rsquo;t be putting block level elements inside inline elements in your HTML - it will <em>almost always</em> work, until it doesn&rsquo;t, and it won&rsquo;t be obvious what exactly is going wrong. Many people new to HTML aren&rsquo;t even aware of HTML resets, so they&rsquo;ll have to try and remember which elements are block-level by default and which aren&rsquo;t. Then the new standard introduced a bunch of psuedo-block level elements that try to fix some of these problems, except they aren&rsquo;t supported by everything because <em>MICROSOFT</em>, so now you&rsquo;re stuck with a bunch of workarounds for IE that take forever to develop.</p><p>Just recently I discovered an amazingly weird bug with my webpage, wherein upon first loading it, all my buttons would be stacked vertically. It appeared that Chrome was ignoring <code>float:left</code> on those elements&mldr; until the page was refreshed or any other part of the website was visited, at which point everything started working again! Firefox, of course, didn&rsquo;t have any issues with it. The problem was that I had a <code>&lt;p></code> element defined as a giant button, then put <code>&lt;a href="">&lt;/a></code> around it because I wanted the entire button to be a link. This, of course, violates the inline/block element mandate I outlined above, despite it being a very natural thing to do - you want the entire button to link somewhere? Put a link around it. It&rsquo;ll <em>almost always</em> work, until it doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Trying to write perfectly standards conformant HTML is exceedingly difficult because half the time what you want to do isn&rsquo;t in the standard or is some hack that works almost all the time but not quite. The rest of the time, the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; way of doing things is completely and utterly bizarre, like using <code>margin:auto 0;</code> to center elements. But wait, that only works on horizontal elements! If you want to vertically center an arbitrary element, you have to use <a href=http://www.jakpsatweb.cz/css/css-vertical-center-solution.html>a lot of weird crap</a> just to get it to work on everything. Or you could just use a table. But tables are bad, so you should never use them, even though they actually solve a whole lot of problems new developers have because their non-table solutions are completely unintuitive, because we&rsquo;re all trying to use a <em>document layout engine</em> to make <em>GUIs</em>, for crying out loud.</p><p>Many web developers argue that these problems are going away now that we have a better standard. Sadly, they are just getting started - WebGL will become exceedingly important in the next 5 years, and its standardization is an <em><a href=http://codeflow.org/entries/2013/feb/22/how-to-write-portable-webgl/#why-portable>absolute mess</a></em> almost to the point of it being unusable. Then there&rsquo;s the sordid situation with HTML5 audio and video, which is only just starting to get tolerable. These problems are not going away - they are simply being replaced by different problems. Of course, some stuff actually is becoming easier in HTML - just like a lot of stuff is becoming easier in C++11. So either you ignore both the new C++ features and the new HTML features, or you admit that C++ has become less horrible recently.</p><p>Of course, C++ is still way too easy to write unmaintainable code in, and HTML/CSS code is clearly self-documenting! Except it obviously isn&rsquo;t, given the endless horror stories of terrifying CSS dependencies with random <code>!important</code> keywords flung around in a giant mess that&rsquo;s just as impossible to understand as templatized C++ hell.</p><p>But wait, if you just write proper HTML, it won&rsquo;t have that problem! Well, <em>duh</em>, if you write proper C++, you don&rsquo;t have that problem either. I&rsquo;m sorry, if you are going to hate something, you can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. If C++ supporting features that can be abused to make code impossible to read, like operator overloading, makes it a bad language, then CSS is a bad language, because there is an endless list of obscure, bizarre syntax you can use in your CSS style sheets (like <code>!important</code>) that will make your HTML almost impossible to read. But wait, C++ is also incredibly hard to parse! HTML being easy to parse must be why Opera recently gave up trying to maintain its own HTML layout engine&mldr; Oh wait. Well at least javascript is a consistent, easy to understand language that doesn&rsquo;t have any weird quirks&mldr; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yZHbh396rc">JUST KIDDING!</a></p><p>So it seems modern technology has succeeded in replacing a very fast, difficult to use, inconsistent language with 3 different, very slow, difficult to use, inconsistent languages.</p><p>Now, if you want to believe that HTML/CSS is still good when used correctly, then all I ask is that you grudgingly admit that, maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, C++ is also good when used correctly. If you still think C++ is an abomination from the depths of cthulu, I hope you can admit that web development therefore must also be an abomination.</p><p>Or we can just keep arguing with each other, because that&rsquo;s always productive.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-02-24T20:54:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-dark-side-of-htmlcss/>February 24, 2013 at 8:54pm</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/the-dark-side-of-htmlcss/#commento>11 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-dark-side-of-htmlcss%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20Web%20Development&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-dark-side-of-htmlcss%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-dark-side-of-htmlcss%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/windows-breaks-assert-inside/>Windows Breaks assert() Inside WM_CANCELMODE</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>So I have this dll that&rsquo;s doing a bunch of horrible WinAPI calls for me. It&rsquo;s designed to abstract away all the pain and unholy functions feeding on innocent blood. Little did I know that trying to cage WinAPI into a more manageable corner would be my undoing.</p><p>The window is created and assigned a WndProc callback function inside this DLL, as per the various absurd requirements involving how you create windows in Windows. Everything works just fine and dandy until the application window suddenly closes, an error &ldquo;ding&rdquo; is heard, and the program silently crashes without any sort of error message whatsoever.</p><p>What just happened?</p><p>Well, I&rsquo;m afraid you just triggered an assertion. But instead of doing what an assertion is supposed to do, which is immediately crash the program so you know what the fuck just happened, it instead somehow manages to create an infinite callback loop caused by the operating system actually trying to <em>assign the assertion dialog to the window</em>. You know, the same window that was part of an application that&rsquo;s supposed to be in the middle of <em>CRASHING</em>?! This causes another message to be sent, thus causing another assertion to be violated, et cetera until the stack overflows, except it doesn&rsquo;t actually tell you the stack overflows, it just crashes with absolutely no explanation. Even while in a debugger, which is truly amazing.</p><p>Specifically, the assertion triggers a dialog box to be displayed, but this dialog box forcibly sends another WM_CANCELMODE message to the application, apparently completely bypassing the entire point of having a message queue, because the program never gets to go back to it. It&rsquo;s WndProc is simply called with WM_CANCELMODE because <em>fuck you</em>, and so if your assertion fails when you&rsquo;re processing WM_CANCELMODE, it will simply do this over and over and over until the entire window tree collapses in on itself from the intense gravitational pull of <em>astronomical amounts of stupidity</em>.</p><p>The resulting black hole sucks in all nearby sources of sanity, which include some sort of error message about the stack overflowing, or perhaps the <em>actual fucking assertion error</em>, and then explodes, leaving you without a goddamn clue about what just happened. This is usually followed by copious amounts of screaming, then disbelief, then finally assuming the fetal position and praying for forgiveness for attempting to touch the windows API, as the Microsoft gods laugh and drag another developer&rsquo;s soul into their black circle of hell.</p><p>Somehow, every time I touch the windows API, it always ends with me curled into a ball, moaning &ldquo;what the fuck&rdquo; over and over again while crying.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-02-07T20:17:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/windows-breaks-assert-inside/>February 7, 2013 at 8:17pm</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/windows-breaks-assert-inside/#commento> comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-breaks-assert-inside%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Windows%20Breaks%20assert%28%29%20Inside%20WM_CANCELMODE&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-breaks-assert-inside%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-breaks-assert-inside%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/the-productivity-fallacy/>The Productivity Fallacy</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Technology tends to serve one of two purposes - to make us more efficient at some task, or to entertain us in our resulting free time. However, when we fixate on productivity to the exclusion of everything else, we often forget about the big picture. Perhaps the best example of this are people insisting that real coders need to use Vim to be productive due to it&rsquo;s unmatched text editing powers.</p><p>This is totally absurd. I spend maybe 10% of my time actually writing code, 30% debugging that code, and the remaining 60% trying to solve a problem. Even if I could write all my code instantly, I have only improved my productivity by 10%. I&rsquo;ve found that changing my code patterns to let me catch bugs faster and earlier has had a much more significant impact on my coding speed, because taking a chunk out of 30% has a much greater effect on my overall productivity.</p><p>But what about the 60%? I&rsquo;m sure I could make some of that go away with more powerful visualization tools and intense mental training, but when I hit a problem that&rsquo;s simply really hard to solve, nothing short of a cybernetic implant that makes my brain bigger is going to make a dent in how much time I spend thinking about something unless I want to make a stupid mistake and regret it later.</p><p>The issue that&rsquo;s arising from our hyperproductive tools is that our productivity is beginning to outstrip our ability to think. We are so productive <em>we can&rsquo;t think fast enough to utilize it</em>. Vim may be the most amazing text editor ever, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because I spend more time thinking than I do actually editing text. We&rsquo;re so focused on making everyone super productive we seem to forget that we are beginning to receive diminishing returns from some of our efforts.</p><p>One consequence of this is that, obviously, we should be focusing on tools to help us think faster. We need to do profiling of people&rsquo;s lives to find the chokepoints and focus on those instead of doing the equivalent of micro-optimizations in C code that&rsquo;s only called every 5 minutes. That, however, does not concern me. What does concern me is the repeated mistakes futurists make when attempting to predict the future of technology.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6cNdhOKwi0">This Microsoft video</a> is a superb example of good technology predictions implemented in the worst way possible. The entire video treats human beings as machinery that needs to complete various tasks in the quickest way possible, instead of recognizing that human beings are, in fact, <em>people</em>. Many of the human interactions feel fake because all the interactions are treated simply as tasks that must be completed efficiently, regardless of how beneficial the time saved actually is. Productivity is not important, the way it <em>feels</em> is important.</p><p>Futuristic architecture often makes this same mistake, creating cold, bland environments that, while they do feel futuristic, are not things anyone would want to live or work in. We need environments that feel warm, inviting, and natural. When building futuristic environments, we must be extremely careful about where the future is peeking in, because there is such a thing as too much future in one room.</p><p>We make things look like wood simply because we like how wood looks, not because we need to build anything out of wood anymore. We like trees growing around our houses. We make our lights look like the sun instead of actually being white. We are constantly making arbitrary choices that have nothing to do with productivity and everything to do with making us feel comfortable. Until designers recognize this and stop sucking the life out of everything in an effort to make it more &ldquo;productive&rdquo;, they will inevitably be shunned in favor of slightly less efficient, but more inviting designs.</p><p>Design is an optimization problem that must maximize both productivity <em>and</em> feel, not one or the other. Some people actually like color in their IDEs and webpages that consist of more than flat text, faint lines and whitespace.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-01-18T17:12:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-productivity-fallacy/>January 18, 2013 at 5:12pm</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/the-productivity-fallacy/#commento>9 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-productivity-fallacy%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Productivity%20Fallacy&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-productivity-fallacy%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-productivity-fallacy%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-4-operator-overload/>C# to C++ Tutorial - Part 4: Operator Overload</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>[ <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/>1</a> · <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/>2</a> · <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-3-classes-and/>3</a> · <strong>4</strong> · <span style=color:#aaa>5 · 6 · 7</span> ]</p><p>If you are familiar with C#, you should be familiar with the difference between C#&rsquo;s <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code> declarations. Namely, a <code>struct</code> is a value type and a <code>class</code> is a reference type, meaning that if you pass a struct to a function, its default behavior is for the entire struct to be <strong>copied</strong> into the function&rsquo;s parameter, so any modifications made to it won&rsquo;t affect whatever was passed in. On the flip side, a class is a reference value, so a <strong>reference</strong> is passed into the function, and any changes made to that reference will be reflected in the object that was originally passed into the function.</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>// Takes an integer, or a basic value type
public static int add(int v)
{
  v+=3;
  return 4+v;
}

public struct Oppa
{
  public string gangnam;
}

// Takes a struct, or a complex value type
public static Oppa style(Oppa g)
{
  g.gangnam=&#34;notstyle&#34;;
  return g;
}

public class Psy
{
  public int style;
}

// Takes a class, or a reference type
public static void change(Psy psy)
{
  psy.style=5;
}

// Takes an integer, but forces it to be passed by reference instead of by value.
public static int addref(ref int v)
{
  v+=3;
  return 4+v;
}

int a = 0;
int b = add(a);
// a is still 0
// b is now 7

int c = addref(a);
// a is now 3, because it was passed by reference
// c is now 7

Oppa s1;
s1.gangnam=&#34;style&#34;;
Oppa s2 = style(s1);
//s1.gangnam is still &#34;style&#34;
//s2.gangnam is now &#34;notstyle&#34;

Psy psy = new Psy();
psy.style=0;
change(psy);
// psy.style is now 5, because it was passed by reference
</code></pre>C++ also lets you pass in parameters by reference and by value, however it is more explicit about what is happening, so there is no default behavior to know about. If you simply declare the type itself, for example <code>(myclass C, int B)</code>, then it will be passed by value and copied. If, however, you use the reference symbol that we&rsquo;ve used before in variable declarations, it will be passed by reference. This happens no matter what. If a reference is passed into a function that takes a value, it will still have a copy made.</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>// Integer passed by value
int add(int v)
{
  v+=3;
  return 4+v;
}

class Psy
{
public:
  int style;
};

// Class passed by value
Psy change(Psy psy)
{
  psy.style=5;
  return psy;
}

// Integer passed by reference
int addref(int&amp; v)
{
  v+=3;
  return 4+v;
}

// Class passed by reference
Psy changeref(Psy&amp; psy)
{
  psy.style=5;
  return psy;
}

int horse = 2;
int korea = add(horse);
// horse is still 2
// korea is now 9

int horse2 = 2;
int korea2 = addref(horse2);
// horse2 is now 5
// korea2 is now 9

Psy psy;
psy.style = 0;
Psy ysp = change(psy);
// psy.style is still 0
// ysp.style is now 5

Psy psy2;
psy2.style = 0;
Psy ysp2 = changeref(psy2);
// psy2.style is now 5
// ysp2.style is also 5
</code></pre>However, in order to copy something, C++ needs to know how to properly copy your class. This gives rise to the <strong>copy constructor</strong>. By default, the compiler will automatically generate a copy constructor for your class that simply invokes all the default copy constructors of whatever member variables you have, just like C#. If, however, your class is holding on to a pointer, then this is going to cause a giant mess when two classes are pointing to the same thing and one of the deletes what it&rsquo;s pointing to! By specifying a copy constructor, we can deal with the pointer properly:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>class myString
{
public:
  // The copy constructor, which copies the string over instead of copying the pointer
  myString(const myString&amp; copy)
  {
    size_t len = strlen(copy._str)+1; //+1 for null terminator
    _str=new char[len];
    memcpy(_str,copy._str,sizeof(char)*len);
  }
  // Normal constructor
  myString(const char* str)
  {
    size_t len = strlen(str);
    _str=new char[len];
    memcpy(_str,str,sizeof(char)*len);
  }
  // Destructor that deallocates our string
  ~myString()
  {
    delete [] _str;
  }

private:
  char* _str;
};

</code></pre>This copy constructor can be invoked manually, but it will simply be implicitly called whenever its needed. Of course, that isn&rsquo;t the only time we need to deal with our rogue pointer that screws things up. What happens when we set our class equal to another class? Remember, <strong>a reference cannot be changed after it is created</strong>. Observe the following behavior:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int a = 3;
int b = 2;
int&amp; ra = a;
int* pa = &amp;a;

b = a; //b is now 3
a = 0; //b is still 3, but a is now 0
b = ra; // b is now 0
a = 5; // b is still 0 but now a is 5
b = *pa; // b is now 5
b = 8; // b is now 8 but a is still 5

ra = b; //a is now 8! This assigns b&#39;s values to ra, it does NOT change the reference!
ra = 9; //a is now 9, and b is still 8! ra STILL refers to a, and NOTHING can change that.

pa = &amp;b; // Now pa points to to b
a = *pa; // a is now 8, because pointers CAN be changed.
*pa = 7; // Now b is 7, but a is still 8

int*&amp; rpa = pa; //Now we have a reference to a pointer (C++11)
//rpa = 5; // COMPILER ERROR, rpa is a reference to a POINTER
int** ppa = &amp;pa;
//rpa = ppa; // COMPILER ERROR, rpa is a REFERENCE to a pointer, not a pointer to a pointer!
rpa = &amp;a; //now pa points to a again. This does NOT change the reference!
b = *pa; // Now b is 8, the same as a.
</code></pre>So somehow, we have to overload the assignment operator! This brings us to <strong>Operator Overloading</strong>. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288467(v=vs.71).aspx">C# operator overloading</a> works by defining <em>global</em> operator overloads, ones that take a left and a right argument, and are static functions. By default, C++ operator overloading only take the <em>right argument</em>. The left side of the equation is implied to be the class itself. Consequently, <strong>C++ operators are not static</strong>. C++ does have global operators, but they are defined <strong>outside the class</strong>, and the assignment operator isn&rsquo;t allowed as a global operator; you have to define it inside the class. All the overload-able operators are shown below with appropriate declarations:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>class someClass
{
someClass operator =(anything b); // me=other
someClass operator +(anything b); // me+other
someClass operator -(anything b); // me-other
someClass operator +(); // +me
someClass operator -(); // -me (negation)
someClass operator *(anything b); // me*other
someClass operator /(anything b); // me/other
someClass operator %(anything b); // me%other
someClass&amp; operator ++(); // ++me
someClass&amp; operator ++(int); // me++
someClass&amp; operator --(); // --me
someClass&amp; operator --(int); // me--
// All operators can TECHNICALLY return any value whatsoever, but for many of them only certain values make sense.
bool operator ==(anything b); 
bool operator !=(anything b);
bool operator &gt;(anything b);
bool operator &lt;(anything b);
bool operator &gt;=(anything b);
bool operator &lt;=(anything b);
bool operator !(); // !me
// These operators do not usually return someClass, but rather a type specific to what the class does.
anything operator &amp;&amp;(anything b); 
anything operator ||(anything b);

anything operator ~();
anything operator &amp;(anything b);
anything operator |(anything b);
anything operator ^(anything b);
anything operator &lt;&lt;(anything b);
anything operator &gt;&gt;(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator +=(anything b); // Should always return *this;
someClass&amp; operator -=(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator *=(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator /=(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator %=(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator &amp;=(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator |=(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator ^=(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator &lt;&lt;=(anything b);
someClass&amp; operator &gt;&gt;=(anything b);
anything operator [](anything b); // This will almost always return a reference to some internal array type, like myElement&amp;
anything operator *();
anything operator &amp;();
anything* operator -&gt;(); // This has to return a pointer or some other type that has the -&gt; operator defined.

anything operator -&gt;*(anything a);
anything operator ()(anything a1, U a2, ...);
anything operator ,(anything b);
operator otherThing(); // Allows this class to have an implicit conversion to type otherThing
void* operator new(size_t x); // These are called when you write new someClass()
void* operator new[](size_tx); // new someClass[num]
void operator delete(void*x); // delete pointer_to_someClass
void operator delete[](void*x); // delete [] pointer_to_someClass

};

// These are global operators that behave more like C# operators, but must be defined outside of classes, and a few operators do not have global overloads, which is why they are missing from this list. Again, operators can technically take or return any value, but normally you only override these so you can handle some other type being on the left side.
someClass operator +(anything a, someClass b);
someClass operator -(anything a, someClass b);
someClass operator +(someClass a);
someClass operator -(someClass a);
someClass operator *(anything a, someClass b);
someClass operator /(anything a, someClass b);
someClass operator %(anything a, someClass b);
someClass operator ++(someClass a);
someClass operator ++(someClass a, int); // Note the unnamed dummy-parameter int - this differentiates between prefix and suffix increment operators.
someClass operator --(someClass a);
someClass operator --(someClass a, int); // Note the unnamed dummy-parameter int - this differentiates between prefix and suffix decrement operators.

bool operator ==(anything a, someClass b);
bool operator !=(anything a, someClass b);
bool operator &gt;(anything a, someClass b);
bool operator &lt;(anything a, someClass b);

</code></pre>We can see that the assignment operator mimics the arguments of our copy constructor. For the most part, it does the exact same thing; the only difference is that existing values must be destroyed, an operation that should mostly mimic the destructor. We extend our previous class to have an assignment operator accordingly:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>class myString
{
public:
  // The copy constructor, which copies the string over instead of copying the pointer
  myString(const myString&amp; copy)
  {

</code></pre>These operations take an instance of the class and copy it&rsquo;s values to our instance. Consequently, these are known as <em>copy semantics</em>. If this was 1998, we&rsquo;d stop here, because for a long time, C++ only had copy semantics. Either you passed around references to objects, or you copied them. You could also pass around pointers to objects, but remember that pointers are value types just like integers and floats, so you are really just copying them around too. In fact, until recently, you were <em>not allowed to have references to pointers</em>. Pointers were the one data type that had to be passed by value. Provided you are using a C++0x-compliant compiler, <strong>this is no longer true</strong>, as you may remember from our <a href>first examples</a>. The new standard <a href=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11>released in 2011</a> allows references to pointers, and introduces <em>move semantics</em>.</p><p>Move semantics are designed to solve the following problem. If we have a series of dynamic string objects being concatenated, with normal copy constructors we run into a serious problem:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>std::string result = std::string(&#34;Oppa&#34;) + std::string(&#34; Gangnam&#34;) + std::string(&#34; Style&#34;) + std::string(&#34; by&#34;) + std::string(&#34; Psy&#34;);
// This is evaluated by first creating a new string object with its own memory allocation, then deallocating both &#34; by&#34; and &#34; Psy&#34; after copying their contents into the new one
//std::string result = std::string(&#34;Oppa&#34;) + std::string(&#34; Gangnam&#34;) + std::string(&#34; Style&#34;) + std::string(&#34; by Psy&#34;);
// Then another new object is made and &#34; by Psy&#34; and &#34; Style&#34; are deallocated
//std::string result = std::string(&#34;Oppa&#34;) + std::string(&#34; Gangnam&#34;) + std::string(&#34; Style by Psy&#34;);
// And so on and so forth
//std::string result = std::string(&#34;Oppa&#34;) + std::string(&#34; Gangnam Style by Psy&#34;);
//std::string result = std::string(&#34;Oppa Gangnam Style by Psy&#34;);
// So just to add 5 strings together, we&#39;ve had to allocate room for 5 additional strings in the middle of it, 4 of which are then simply deallocated!
</code></pre>This is terribly inefficient; it would be much more efficient if we could utilize the temporary objects that are going to be destroyed anyway instead of reallocating a bunch of memory over and over again only to delete it immediately afterwards. This is where move semantics come in to play. First, we need to define a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; object as one whose scope is entirely contained on <em>the right side of an expression</em>. That is to say, given a single assignment statement <code>a=b</code>, if an object is both created and destroyed inside <code>b</code>, then it is considered temporary. Because of this, these temporary values are also called <em>rvalues</em>, short for &ldquo;right values&rdquo;. C++0x introduces the syntax <code>variable&&</code> to designate an rvalue. This is how you declare a move constructor:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>class myString
{
public:
  // The copy constructor, which copies the string over instead of copying the pointer
  myString(const myString&amp; copy)
  {
    size_t len = strlen(copy._str)+1; //+1 for null terminator
    _str=new char[len];
    memcpy(_str,copy._str,sizeof(char)*len);
  }
  // Move Constructor
  myString(myString&amp;&amp; mov)
  {
    _str = mov._str;
    mov._str=NULL;
  }
  // Normal constructor
  myString(const char* str)
  {
    size_t len = strlen(str);
    _str=new char[len];
    memcpy(_str,str,sizeof(char)*len);
  }
  // Destructor that deallocates our string
  ~myString()
  {
    if(_str!=NULL) // Make sure we only delete _str if it isn&#39;t NULL!
      delete [] _str;
  }

  // Assignment operator, does the same thing the copy constructor does, but also mimics the destructor by deleting _str. NOTE: It is considered bad practice to call the destructor directly. Use a Clear() method or something equivalent instead.
  myString&amp; operator=(const myString&amp; right)
  {
    delete [] _str;
    size_t len = strlen(right._str)+1; //+1 for null terminator
    _str=new char[len];
    memcpy(_str,right._str,sizeof(char)*len);
    return *this;
  }

private:
  char* _str;
};</code></pre><strong>NOTE: Observe that our destructor functionality was changed! Now that _str can be NULL, we have to check for that before deleting the object.</strong></p><p>The idea behind a move constructor is that, instead of <em>copying</em> the values into our object, we <em>move</em> them into our object, setting the source to some <code>NULL</code> value. Notice that this can only work for pointers, or objects containing pointers. Integers, floats, and other similar types can&rsquo;t really be &ldquo;moved&rdquo;, so instead their values are simply copied over. Consequently, move semantics is only beneficial for types like strings that involve dynamic memory allocation. However, because we must set the source pointers to 0, that means we can&rsquo;t use <code>const myString&&</code>, because then we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to modify the source pointers! This is why a move constructor is declared without a const modifier, which makes sense, since we intend to modify the object.</p><p>But wait, just like a copy constructor has an assignment copy operator, a move constructor has an equivalent assignment move operator. Just like the copy assignment, the move operator behaves exactly like the move constructor, but must destroy the existing object beforehand. The assignment move operator is declared like this:</p><pre class=language-cpp><code>myString&amp; operator=(myString&amp;&amp; right)
  {
    delete [] _str;
    _str=right._str;
    right._str=0;
    return *this;
  }
</code></pre><p>Move semantics can be used for some interesting things, like unique pointers, that <em>only</em> have move semantics - by disabling the copy constructor, you can create an object that is impossible to copy, and can therefore only be moved, which guarantees that there will only be one copy of its contents in existence. <code>std::unique_ptr</code> is an implementation of this provided in C++0x. Note that if a data structure requires copy semantics, <code>std::unique_ptr</code> will throw a compiler error, instead of simply mysteriously failing like the deprecated <code>std::autoptr</code>.</p><p>There is an important detail when you are using inheritance or objects with move semantics:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>class Substring : myString
{
  Substring(Substring&amp;&amp; mov) : myString(std::move(mov))
  {
    _sub = std::move(mov._sub);
  }

  Substring&amp; operator=(Substring&amp;&amp; right)
  {
    myString::operator=(std::move(right));
    _sub = std::move(mov._sub);
    return *this;
  }

  myString _sub;
};
</code></pre>Here we are using <code>std::move()</code>, which takes a variable (that is either an rvalue or a normal reference) and returns an rvalue for that variable. This is because rvalues <em>stop being rvalues</em> the instant they are passed into a different function, which makes sense, since they are no longer on the right-hand side anymore. Consequently, if we were to pass <code>mov</code> above into our base class, it would trigger the <em>copy constructor</em>, because <code>mov</code> would be treated as <code>const Substring&</code>, instead of <code>Substring&&</code>. Using <code>std::move</code> lets us pass it in as <code>Substring&&</code> and properly trigger the move semantics. As you can see in the example, you must use <code>std::move</code> when moving any complex object, using base class constructors, or base class assignment operators. Note that <code>std::move</code> allows you to force an object to be moved to another object regardless of whether or not its actually an rvalue. This would be particularly useful for moving around <code>std::unique_ptr</code> objects.</p><p>There&rsquo;s some other weird things you can do with move semantics. This most interesting part is the strange behavior of <code>&&</code> when it is appended to existing references.</p><ul><li><code>A& &</code> becomes <code>A&</code></li><li><strong><code>A& &&</code> becomes <code>A&</code></strong></li><li><code>A&& &</code> becomes <code>A&</code></li><li><strong><code>A&& &&</code> becomes <code>A&&</code></strong></li></ul><p>By taking advantage of the second and fourth lines, we can perform <em>perfect forwarding</em>. Perfect forwarding allows us to pass an argument as either a normal reference (<code>A&</code>) or an rvalue (<code>A&&</code>) and then <em>forward it</em> into another function, preserving its status as an rvalue or a normal reference, including whether or not it&rsquo;s <code>const A&</code> or <code>const A&&</code>. Perfect forwarding can be implemented like so:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>template&lt;typename U&gt;
void Set(U &amp;&amp; other)
{
  _str=std::forward&lt;U&gt;(other);
}
</code></pre>Notice that this allows us to assign our data object using either the copy assignment, or the move assignment operator, by using <code>std::forward&lt;U>()</code>, which transforms our reference into either an rvalue if it was an rvalue, or a normal reference if it was a normal reference, much like <code>std::move()</code> transforms everything into an rvalue. However, this requires a template, which may not always be correctly inferred. A more robust implementation uses two separate functions forwarding their parameters into a helper function:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>class myString
{
public:
  // The copy constructor, which copies the string over instead of copying the pointer
  myString(const myString&amp; copy)
  {
    size_t len = strlen(copy._str)+1; //+1 for null terminator
    _str=new char[len];
    memcpy(_str,copy._str,sizeof(char)*len);
  }
  // Move Constructor
  myString(myString&amp;&amp; mov)
  {
    _str = mov._str;
    mov._str=NULL;
  }
  // Normal constructor
  myString(const char* str)
  {
    size_t len = strlen(str);
    _str=new char[len];
    memcpy(_str,str,sizeof(char)*len);
  }
  // Destructor that deallocates our string
  ~myString()
  {
    if(_str!=NULL) // Make sure we only delete _str if it isn&#39;t NULL!
      delete [] _str;
  }
  void Set(myString&amp;&amp; str)
  {
    _set&lt;myString&amp;&amp;&gt;(std::move(str));
  }
  void Set(const myString&amp; str)
  {
    _set&lt;const myString&amp;&gt;(str);
  }


  // Assignment operator, does the same thing the copy constructor does, but also mimics the destructor by deleting _str. NOTE: It is considered bad practice to call the destructor directly. Use a Clear() method or something equivalent instead.
  myString&amp; operator=(const myString&amp; right)
  {
    delete [] _str;
    size_t len = strlen(right._str)+1; //+1 for null terminator
    _str=new char[len];
    memcpy(_str,right._str,sizeof(char)*len);
    return *this;
  }

private:
  template&lt;typename U&gt;
  void _set(U &amp;&amp; other)
  {
    _str=std::forward&lt;U&gt;(other);
  }

  char* _str;
};
</code></pre>Notice the use of <code>std::move()</code> to transfer the rvalue correctly, followed by <code>std::forward&lt;U>()</code> to forward the parameter. By using this, we avoid redundant code, but can still build move-aware data structures that efficiently assign values with relative ease. Now, its on to <a href=#>Part 5: Delegated Llamas</a>! Or, well, delegates, function pointers, and lambdas. Possibly involving llamas.
