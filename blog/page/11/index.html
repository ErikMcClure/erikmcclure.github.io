― Philip K. Dick</blockquote><p>Nowadays, you aren&rsquo;t supposed to write anything yourself. In the world of open-source software, you&rsquo;re supposed to find a library that does what you want, and if that doesn&rsquo;t work, commit a change that makes it work. Writing your own library is a bad thing because it&rsquo;s perceived as redundant if there&rsquo;s already a library that does most of what you want. The problem is that this is inherently anti-competitive. If there&rsquo;s only one library that does something, you have a monopoly, and then you get <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed>Heartbleed</a>, because there&rsquo;s zero diversification. However, if I try to invent my own wheel, I&rsquo;ll just be scolded and told to contribute to an existing wheel instead, even if my wheel needs to have giant spikes on it.</p><p>I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if these people actually understand how software works. Code is not some kind of magical, amorphous blob that can just <em>get better</em>. It&rsquo;s a skyscraper, built on top of layers and layers of code, all sitting on top of a foundation that dictates the direction the code evolves in. If someone invents a better way to architect your program, you can&rsquo;t just swap pieces of it out anymore, because you are literally <em>changing how the pieces fit together</em> in order to improve the program. Now, I&rsquo;m sure many coders would say that, if there&rsquo;s a better architecture, you should just rip the entire program apart and rebuild it the better way.</p><p>The problem is that <em>there is no one-size fits all solution</em> for a given task. <strong>Ever</strong>. This is true for any discipline, and it is still true in the magical world of programming no matter how loudly you shout &ldquo;LALALALALALA&rdquo; while plugging your ears. By <em>definition</em> you cannot create a software library that is constructed in two different ways, because that is literally <em>two different software libraries</em>. Thus, just like how we have many different wheels for different situations, it is perfectly fine to reinvent the wheel to better suit the problem you are tackling instead of trying to extend an existing library to do what you want, because otherwise you&rsquo;ll end up with a bloated piece of crap that still doesn&rsquo;t do what you want. If you actually believe that it is possible to write a vector math library that covers all possible use scenarios for every possible solution, then I invite you to put monster truck tires on your smartcar and tell me how well that works. We might as well ask the Flying Spaghetti Monster to solve our problems instead.</p><p>You <em>want</em> there to be several different libraries for rendering vector graphics. You <em>want</em> there to be many different programming languages. You <em>want</em> there to be multiple text layout engines. These things create competition, and as each codebase vies to be used by more and more people, each will start catering to a slightly different set of problems. This creates lots of different tools that programmers can use, so instead of having to use their Super Awesome Mega Swiss Army Knife 4000, they can just use a butter knife because <em>that&rsquo;s all they goddamn need</em>.</p><p>At this point, most coders will struggle to defend their position by falling back on the tried and true saying of &ldquo;well, for most programmers, this is perfectly reasonable.&rdquo; Exactly what do they mean by <em>most programmers</em>? Because <em>most programmers</em> use <a href=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/top-10-programming-languages>C++, C, and Java</a>, and are probably maintaining systems that are 20 years old and couldn&rsquo;t possibly apply anything they were just told in any realistic scenario. Do they just mean programmers who are making hip WebGL applications? What arbitrary subset of programmers are we talking about here? Of course, at this point, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because they are literally cherry picking whatever programming community supports their opinion, and we&rsquo;re praying to the Flying Spaghetti Monster again.</p><p>Diversity is important. I am tired of programmers living in some fantasy world where all diversity has been eliminated and everyone follows the One True Path, and uses the One True Library for each individual task. This is not a world I want to live in, because <em>my problems are not your problems</em>, and even if your library is amazing at solving your problems, it probably won&rsquo;t solve mine. I&rsquo;ll go even further and say that this kind of thinking is <em>dangerous</em>. It reeks of cargo-cult coding and institutionalized knowledge designed to destroy creativity.</p><p>When people say you shouldn&rsquo;t re-invent the wheel, they mean you shouldn&rsquo;t re-invent the wheel if that&rsquo;s <em>not what you&rsquo;re trying to do</em>. If your main goal is to make a game, you shouldn&rsquo;t write a graphics engine. If your main goal is to make a webpage, you shouldn&rsquo;t write a webpage designer. However, if you just finished a game and think &ldquo;Gee, that graphics engine was terrible, I&rsquo;m going to make a better one,&rdquo; then writing your own graphics engine is <em>perfectly fine</em>.</p><p>Including the entire jQuery library just so you can have the <code>$("id")</code> shortcut is like driving a smartcar with spiked monster truck wheels down a freeway. It&rsquo;s dangerous, stupid, and completely unnecessary.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2014-11-22T00:15:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/not-reinventing-wheel-is-anticompetitive/>November 22, 2014 at 12:15am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/not-reinventing-wheel-is-anticompetitive/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;6 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fnot-reinventing-wheel-is-anticompetitive%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Never%20Reinventing%20The%20Wheel%20Is%20Anticompetitive%20&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fnot-reinventing-wheel-is-anticompetitive%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fnot-reinventing-wheel-is-anticompetitive%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/everyone-can-be-above-average/>Everyone Can Be Above Average</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><blockquote>*When everyone's special, no one is.*
— Anonymous</blockquote><p>Time and time again, I hear the wise old members of our society insisting that my generation has been gravely misled. They claim that, by telling every child that they are special, no one is. They claim that everyone can&rsquo;t be above average.</p><p>This is painfully ridiculous.</p><p>When someone says that every child is special, they are saying that each child is special <em>in their own way</em>. Each child is blessed with a gift of their own, wholly unique to them. Every child being above average is only a paradox if you are lumping every single human experience into one giant number, which is an insulting perversion of the diversity of life.</p><p>No human being will ever produce the exact same art, or solve a problem in the exact same way. Each of us brings our own unique experiences to the table, and that is why we are all valuable. Only by exploring a plurality of techniques can we find a better one. Only by bringing to bear a huge number of unique perspectives on a problem can we find an exceptionally elegant solution. <em>One</em> of those perspectives will see something that most of us don&rsquo;t. <em>One</em> of those perspectives will create a work of art that no other human being could have conceived.</p><p>Yes, every child <em>is</em> special. Yes, every child <em>can</em> be above average&mldr; <em>in their chosen field of interest</em>.</p><p>A good example of this is to look at artists. Almost any artist who can do rudimentary shading is an above average artist. This is because most people aren&rsquo;t professional artists. Once you start looking at professions, having even the tiniest drop of talent will likely catapult you into being above average, because our modern world is full of specialists. If you pick any random profession, the average skill level of that profession, when summing over the whole of the human race, will be close to zero, because most people aren&rsquo;t in that profession.</p><p>So, simply by choosing a profession and learning the basics of it, a human being will be capable of doing things most other people can&rsquo;t.</p><p>Telling kids they&rsquo;re special is simply saying that they are unique, and that no other human being is like them. This is, much to the frustration of the institutions who would prefer us to be mindless factory drones, the truth. We each approach life in our own way, slightly different from everyone else. One person&rsquo;s perspective may seem useless and bland, just a pale shadow of everyone else, until they happen to stumble on that one place where their slightly different view of the world let&rsquo;s them see something no one else can.</p><p>When talking about a person as a whole, no one is <em>better</em> than anyone else. We simply experience the world in different, equally valid ways. We can be better than other people at a <em>specific thing</em>, but not in general.</p><p>Every snowflake is unique, but only when you look at them under a microscope. In the grand flurry of life, they all seem to blur together, forming featureless piles of uniformity. It is not enough to look for the truly exceptional. We must recognize that even the most insignificant details can make all the difference in the world.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the little things that matter.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2014-10-18T01:13:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/everyone-can-be-above-average/>October 18, 2014 at 1:13am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/everyone-can-be-above-average/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;1 comment</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-can-be-above-average%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Everyone%20Can%20Be%20Above%20Average&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-can-be-above-average%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-can-be-above-average%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/can-we-choose-what-we-enjoy/>Can We Choose What We Enjoy?</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>One of the most bizarre arguments I have ever heard in ethics is whether or not people can choose to be gay or not. The idea is, if being gay is genetically predetermined, it&rsquo;s not their fault, therefore you can&rsquo;t prosecute them for something they have no control over.</p><p>Since when did <em>anyone</em> get to choose what makes them happy? Can you <em>choose</em> to like strawberries? Can you <em>choose</em> to enjoy the smell of dandelions? At best, you can subject yourself to something over and over and over again and enjoy it as a sort of acquired taste, but this doesn&rsquo;t always work, and the fact remains that you are still predisposed to enjoying certain experiences. Unless we make a concentrated effort to change our preferences, <em>all</em> enjoyable sensory experiences occur <em>without our consent</em>. We are not in charge of what combination of neural impulses our brain happens to find enjoyable. All we can do is slowly influence those preferences, and even then, only sometimes.</p><p>This concept of people <em>choosing</em> what they enjoy seems to have infected society, and is often at the root of much bizarre and often unfair prosecution. If we assume that people cannot significantly change the preferences they were dealt by life, either as a result of genetic or environmental influences, a host of moral issues become apparent.</p><p>Gender roles stop making sense. In fact, prosecuting anyone on the LGTB spectrum immediately becomes invalid. Attacking anyone&rsquo;s sexual preferences, provided they are harmless, becomes unacceptable. Trying to attack anyone&rsquo;s artistic or musical preferences becomes difficult, at best. We know for a fact that someone&rsquo;s culinary preferences are influenced by the genetic distribution of taste buds in their mouth. It&rsquo;s even hard to properly critique someone&rsquo;s fashion choices if they happened to despise denim or some other fabric.</p><p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the answer to the question &ldquo;why would someone like [x]&rdquo; is always &ldquo;because their brain is wired in a way that enjoys it.&rdquo; Humans are, at a fundamental level, sensory processing machines that accidentally achieved self-awareness. We enjoy something because we are programmed to enjoy it. To insult what kinds of sensory input someone enjoys simply because they do not match up with your own is laughably juvenile. The only time this kind of critique is valid is when someone&rsquo;s preferences cause harm to another person. We all have our own unique ways of processing sensory input, and so we will naturally enjoy different things, through no fault of our own. Sometimes, with a substantial amount of effort, we can slowly change some of those preferences, but most of the time, we&rsquo;re stuck with whatever we were born with (or whatever environmental factors shaped our perception in our childhood).</p><p>Instead of accusing someone of liking something you don&rsquo;t approve of, maybe next time you should try to understand <em>why</em> they like it, instead. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find a new friend.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2014-08-08T13:14:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/can-we-choose-what-we-enjoy/>August 8, 2014 at 1:14pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/can-we-choose-what-we-enjoy/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;2 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcan-we-choose-what-we-enjoy%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Can%20We%20Choose%20What%20We%20Enjoy%3f&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcan-we-choose-what-we-enjoy%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcan-we-choose-what-we-enjoy%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/how-to-make-your-profiler-10x-faster/>How To Make Your Profiler 10x Faster</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Frustrated with C profilers that are either so minimal as to be useless, or giant behemoths that require you to install device drivers, I started writing a lightweight profiler for my <a href=http://bss-util.blackspherestudios.com>utility library</a>. I already had a high precision timer class, so it was just a matter of using a radix trie that didn&rsquo;t blow up the cache. I was very careful about minimizing the impact the profiler had on the code, even going so far as to check if extended precision floating point calculations were slowing it down.</p><p>Of course, since I was writing a profiler, I could use the profiler to profile itself. By pretending to profile a random number added to a cache-murdering int stuck in the middle of an array, I could do a fairly good simulation of profiling a function, while also profiling the act of profiling the function. The difference between the two measurements is how much overhead the profiler has. Unfortunately, my initial results were&mldr; <em>unfavorable</em>, to say the least.<pre class=language-cil><code>BSS Profiler Heat Output: 
[main.cpp:3851] test_PROFILE: 1370173 µs   [##########
  [code]: 545902.7 µs   [##########

  [main.cpp:3876] beginend: 1645.466 ns   [.         
</code></pre>The profiler had an overhead of almost <em>4 microseconds</em>. When you&rsquo;re dealing with functions that are called thousands of times a second, you need to be aware of code speed on the scale of <em>nanoseconds</em>, and this profiler would <em>completely ruin</em> the code. At first, I thought it was my fault, but none of my tweaks seemed to have any measureable effect on the speed whatsoever. On a whim, I decided to comment out the actual _querytime function that was calling QueryPerformanceCounter, then run an external profiler on it.<pre class=language-cil><code>Average control: 35 ns</code></pre><em>What?!</em> Well no wonder my tweaks weren&rsquo;t doing anything, all <em>my</em> code was taking a scant <em>35 nanoseconds</em> to run. The other <strong>99.9%</strong> of the time was spent on that single, stupid call, which also happened to be the one call I couldn&rsquo;t get rid of. However, that isn&rsquo;t the end of the story; _querytime() looks like this:<pre class=language-cpp><code>void cHighPrecisionTimer::_querytime(unsigned __int64* _pval)
{
  DWORD procmask=_getaffinity(); 
  HANDLE curthread = GetCurrentThread();
  SetThreadAffinityMask(curthread, 1);
  
  QueryPerformanceCounter((LARGE_INTEGER*)_pval);
  
  SetThreadAffinityMask(curthread, procmask);
}
</code></pre></p><p>Years ago, it was standard practice to wrap all calls to QueryPerformanceCounter in a CPU core mask to force it to operate on a single core due to potential glitches in the BIOS messing up your calculations. Microsoft itself had recommended it, and you could find this same code in almost any open-source library that was taking measurements. It turns out that this is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn553408(v=vs.85).aspx">no longer necessary</a>:</p><blockquote>**Do I need to set the thread affinity to a single core to use QPC?**<p>No. For more info, see Guidance for acquiring time stamps. This scenario is neither necessary nor desirable.</blockquote></p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t get rid of the QueryPerformanceCounter call itself, but I could get rid of all that other crap it was doing. I commented it out, and <em>voilà!</em> The overhead had been reduced to a scant <em>340 nanoseconds</em>, only a tenth of what it had been before. I&rsquo;m still spending 90% of my calculation time calling that stupid function, but there isn&rsquo;t much I can do about that. Either way, it was a good reminder about the entire reason for using a profiler - bottlenecks tend to crop up in the most unexpected places.</p><pre class=language-cil><code>BSS Profiler Heat Output:

  [main.cpp:3856] control: 169.954 ns   [.         
</code></pre><p>I also tried adding standard deviation measurements, but that ended up giving me ludicrous values of 342±27348 ns, which isn&rsquo;t very helpful. Apparently there&rsquo;s quite a lot of variance in function call times, so much so that while the averages always tend to be the same over time, the statistical variance goes through the roof. This is probably why most profilers don&rsquo;t include the standard deviation. I <em>was</em> able to add in accurate unprofiled code measurements, though, and the profiler uses a dynamic triple magnitude method of displaying how much time a function takes.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2014-06-28T17:31:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-to-make-your-profiler-10x-faster/>June 28, 2014 at 5:31pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/how-to-make-your-profiler-10x-faster/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-make-your-profiler-10x-faster%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20To%20Make%20Your%20Profiler%2010x%20Faster&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-make-your-profiler-10x-faster%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-make-your-profiler-10x-faster%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/the-problem-with-photorealism/>The Problem With Photorealism</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Many people assume that modern graphics technology is now capable of rendering photorealistic video games. If you define <em>photorealistic</em> as <em>any still frame is indistinguishable from a real photo</em>, then we can get pretty close. Unfortunately, the problem with video games is that they are not still frames - they <em>move</em>.</p><p>What people don&rsquo;t realize is that modern games rely on faking a lot of stuff, and that means they only <em>look</em> photorealistic in a very tight set of circumstances. They rely on you not paying close attention to environmental details so you don&rsquo;t notice that the grass is actually just painted on to the terrain. They precompute environmental convolution maps and bake ambient occlusion and radiance information into level architecture. You can&rsquo;t knock down a building in a game unless it is specifically programmed to be breakable and all the necessary preparations are made. Changes in levels are often scripted, with complex physical changes and graphical consequences being largely precomputed and simply triggered at the appropriate time.</p><p>Modern photorealism, like the 3D graphics of ages past, is smoke and mirrors, the result of very talented programmers and artists using tricks of the eye to convince you that a level is much more detailed and interactive than it really is. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this, but we&rsquo;re so good at doing it that people think we&rsquo;re a heck of a lot closer to photorealistic games then we really are.</p><p>If you want to go beyond simple photorealism and build a game that <em>feels</em> real, you have to deal with a lot of extremely difficult problems. Our best antialiasing methods are perceptual, because doing real antialiasing is prohibitively expensive. Global illumination is achieved by deconstructing a level&rsquo;s polygons into an octree and using the GPU to cubify moving objects in realtime. Many advanced graphical techniques in use today depend on precomputed values and static geometry. The assumption that most of the world is probably going to stay the same is a powerful one, and enables huge amounts of optimization. Unfortunately, as long as we make that assumption, none of it will ever feel truly real.</p><p>Trying to build a world that does not take anything for granted rapidly spirals out of control. Where do you draw the line? Does gravity always point down? Does the atmosphere always behave the same way? Is the sun always yellow? What counts as solid ground? What happens when you blow it up? Is the object you&rsquo;re standing on even a <em>planet?</em> Imagine trying to code an engine that can take into account all of these possibilities <em>in realtime</em>. This is clearly horrendously inefficient, and yet there is no other way to achieve a <em>true</em> dynamic environment. At some point, we will have to make assumptions about what will and will not change, and these sometimes have surprising consequences. A volcanic eruption, for example, drastically changes the atmospheric composition and completely messes up the ambient lighting and radiosity.</p><p>Ok, well, at least we have dynamic animations, right? <strong>Wrong.</strong> Almost all modern games still use precomputed animations. Some fancy technology can occasionally try to interpolate between them, but that&rsquo;s about it. We have no reliable method of generating animations on the fly that don&rsquo;t look horrendously awkward and stiff. It turns out that trying to calculate a limb&rsquo;s shortest path from point A to point B while avoiding awkward positions and obstacles amounts to solving the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation>Euler-Lagrange equation</a> over an <em>n-dimensional manifold!</em> As a result, it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to create smooth animations, because our ability to fluidly shift from one animation to another is extremely limited. This is why we still have weird looking walk animations and occasional animation jumping.</p><p>The worst problem, however, is that of <em>content creation</em>. The simple fact is that at photorealistic detail levels, it takes way too long for a team of artists to build a believable world. Even if we had super amazing 3D modelers that would allow an artist to craft any small object in a matter of minutes (which we don&rsquo;t), artists aren&rsquo;t machines. Things look real because they have a history behind them, a reason for their current state of being. We can make photorealistic CGI for movies because each scene is scripted and has a well-defined scope. If you&rsquo;re building GTA V, you can&rsquo;t somehow manage to come up with three hundred unique histories for every single suburban house you&rsquo;re building.</p><p>Even if we <em>did</em> invent a way to render photorealistic graphics, it would all be for naught until we figured out a way to generate obscene amounts of content at incredibly high levels of detail. Older games weren&rsquo;t just easier to render, they were easier to <em>make</em>. There comes a point where no matter how many artists you hire, you simply can&rsquo;t build an expansive game world at a photorealistic level of detail in just 3 years.</p><p>People always talk about realtime raytracing as the holy grail of graphics programming without realizing just what is required to take advantage of it. Photorealism isn&rsquo;t just about processing power, it&rsquo;s about <em>content</em>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2014-03-18T09:05:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-problem-with-photorealism/>March 18, 2014 at 9:05am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/the-problem-with-photorealism/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;8 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-problem-with-photorealism%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Problem%20With%20Photorealism&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-problem-with-photorealism%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-problem-with-photorealism%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><div class=pager><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/10>Newer</a></li><li style=text-align:center><a href=/blog/>Home</a></li><li style=text-align:right><a href=/blog/page/12>Older</a></li></ul></div></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2024</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/>Engineers Only Get Paid If Something Is Broken</a></li><li><a href=/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/>Measuring Competence Is Epistemic Hell</a></li><li><a href=/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/>We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/>People Can't Care About Everything</a></li><li><a href=/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</a></li><li><a href=/blog/age-of-bullshit/>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</a></li><li><a href=/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
