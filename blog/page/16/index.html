In the interests of SCIENCE (and possibly accidentally DDoSing Randall's image server - sorry!), I created a static HTML file of the <strong><a href=http://blackspherestudios.com/storage/xkcd_huge_static.html>entire composite image</a></strong>.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The collage is made up of 225 images<sup>2</sup> that stretch out over a total image area 79872 pixels high and 165888 pixels wide. The images take up 5.52 MB of space and are named with a simple naming scheme <code>"ydxd.png"</code> where d represents a cardinal direction appropriate for the axis (n for north, s for south on the y axis and e for east, w for west on the x axis) along with the tile coordinate number; for example, <code>"1n1e.png"</code>. Tiles are 2048x2048 png images with an average size of 24.53 KB. If you were to try and represent this as a single, uncompressed 32-bit 79872x165888 image file, it would take up 52.99 GB of space.</p><p>Assuming a human's average height is 1.8 meters, that would give this image a scale of about 1 meter per 22 pixels. That means the total composite image is approximately 3.63 kilometers high and 7.54 kilometers wide. It would take an average human 1.67 hours to walk from one end of the image to the other. Note that the characters at the far left say they've been walking for 2 miles - they are 67584 pixels from the starting point, which translates to 3.072 km or ~1.9 miles, so this seems to indicate my rough estimates here are reasonably accurate.</p><p>If Randall spent, on average, one hour drawing each frame, it would take him 9.375 days of constant, nonstop work to finish this. If he instead spent an average of 10 minutes per frame, it would take ~37.5 hours, or almost an entire 40-hour work week.</p><p>Basically I'm saying Randall Munroe is fucking insane.</p><span style=font-size:80%><sup>1</sup> If you are on firefox or chrome, right-clicking and selecting "Save as" will download the HTML file along with all 225 images into a separate folder.

It is a tendency to paint things in a black and white fashion, as if there are simply wrong answers and right answers and nothing in-between. While I have seen this in every single imaginable discipline (including art and music, which is particularly disturbing), it is most obvious to me in the realm of programming.</p><p>When people aren't making astonishingly over-generalized statements like trying to say one programming language is better than another without context, we often try to find the &ldquo;best&rdquo; way to do something. The problem is that we don't often bother to think about exactly what makes the best answer the <em>best answer</em>. Does it have to be fast? If speed was the only thing that was important, we'd write everything in assembly. Does it have to be simple? I could list a thousand instances were simplicity fails to account for edge-cases that render the code useless. Does it have to be easy to understand? If you want something to be easy to understand, then the entire C standard library is one giant wrong answer that's being relied upon by virtually every single program in the entire world.</p><p>For a concept taken for granted by most programmers, defining what exactly makes an implementation &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; is incredibly difficult. A frightening number of programmers are also incapable of realizing this, and continue to hang on to basic assumptions that one would think should hold everywhere, when very few of them actually do. Things like &ldquo;the program should not crash&rdquo; seem reasonable, but what if you want to ensure that a safety feature crashed the program instead of corrupting the system?</p><p>The knee-jerk reaction to this is &ldquo;Oh yeah, <em>except for that</em>.&rdquo; This phrase seems to underlie many of the schisms in the programming community. Virtually every single assumption that could be held by a programmer will be wrong <em><strong>somewhere</strong></em>. I regularly encounter programmers who think you should do something a specific way no matter what, until you ask them about making a kernel. &ldquo;Oh yeah, <em>except for that</em>.&rdquo; Or a sound processing library. &ldquo;Oh yeah, <em>except for that</em>.&rdquo; Or a rover on mars. Or a video decoder. Or a raytracer. Or a driver. Or a compiler. Or a robot. Or scientific computing.</p><p>All these <em>except-for-that</em>&lsquo;s betray the fundamental failure of modern programming culture: <strong>There is no right answer</strong>. The entire concept of Right and Wrong does not belong in programming, because you are trying to find your way to a solution and there are billions of ways to get there, and the one that works best for your particular situation depends on hundreds of thousands of independent variables. Yet, there is a &ldquo;right answer&rdquo; on Stack Overflow. There are books on writing &ldquo;proper code&rdquo;. There are &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;. People talk about programming solutions that are &ldquo;more right&rdquo; than others. There are black and white, right and wrong, yes or no questions pervading the consciousness of the majority of programmers, who foolishly think that you can actually reduce an engineering problem into a mathematical one, despite <a href="http://www.bailopan.net/blog/?p=7">overwhelming evidence</a> that you simply cannot escape the clutches of reality and how long it takes an electron to reach the other side of a silicon wafer.</p><p>If you ask someone how to do something the right way, you are asking the wrong question. You should be asking them <em>how to solve your problem</em>. You didn't do something the wrong way, you simply <em>solved the wrong problem</em>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-08-22T18:40:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/what-is-right-answer/>August 22, 2012 at 6:40pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/what-is-right-answer/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;4 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhat-is-right-answer%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What%20Is%20A%20Right%20Answer%3f&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhat-is-right-answer%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhat-is-right-answer%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/coordinate-systems-and-cascading/>Coordinate Systems And Cascading Stupidity</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Today I learned that there are way too many coordinate systems, and that I'm an idiot (but that was already well-established). I have also learned to not trust graphics tutorials, but the reasons for that won't become apparent until the end of this article.</p><p>There are <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Orientation_and_handedness>two types of coordinate systems</a>: left-handed and right-handed coordinate systems. By convention, most everyone in math and science uses right-handed coordinate systems with positive x going to the right, positive y going up, and positive z coming out of the screen. A left-handed coordinate system is the same, but positive z instead points into the screen. Of course, there are many other possible coordinate system configurations, each either being right or left-handed; some modern CAD packages have y pointing into the screen and z pointing up, and screen-space in graphics traditionally has y pointing down and z pointing into the screen.</p><p>If you start digging through DirectX and OpenGL, the handedness of the coordinate systems being used are ill-defined due to its reliance on various perspective transforms. Consequently, while DirectX traditionally uses a left-handed coordinate system and OpenGL uses a right-handed coordinate system, you can simply use <code>D3DPerspectiveMatrixRH</code> to give DirectX a right-handed coordinate system, and openGL actually uses a left-handed coordinate system by default on its shader pipeline - but all of these are entirely dependent on the handedness of the projection matrices involved. So, technically the coordinate system is whichever one you choose, but unlike the rest of the world, computer graphics has no real standard on which coordinate system to use, and so its just a giant mess of various coordinate systems all over the place, which means you don't know what handedness a given function is for until things start getting funky.</p><p>I discovered all this, because today I found out that, for the past 6 or so years (the entire time my graphics engine has ever existed in any shape or form), it has been <strong>rotating everything backwards</strong>. I didn't notice.</p><p>This happened due to a number of unfortunate coincidences. For many years, I simply didn't notice because I didn't know what direction the sign of a given rotation was supposed to rotate in, and even if I did I would have assumed this to be the default for graphics for some strange reason (there are a <em>lot</em> of weird things in graphics). The first hint was when I was integrating with Box2D and I had to reverse the rotation of its bodies to match up with my images. This did trigger an investigation, but I mistakenly concluded that it was <em>Box2D</em> that had it wrong, not me, because I was using <code>atan2</code> to check coordinates, and I was passing them in as <code>atan2(v.x,v.y)</code>. The problem is that <code>atan2</code> is defined as <code>float atan2(float y, float x)</code>, which means my coordinates were reversed and I was getting nonsense angles.</p><p>Now, here you have to understand that I was currently using a standard left-handed coordinate system, with y pointing up, x pointing right and z into the screen. The thing is, I wanted a coordinate system where y pointed <em>down</em>, and so I did as a tutorial instructed me to and reversed all of my y coordinates on the low-level drawing functions.</p><p>So, when <code>atan2(x,y)</code> gave me bad results, I mistakenly thought &ldquo;Oh, i forgot to reverse the y coordinate!&rdquo; Suddenly <code>atan2(x,-y)</code> was giving me angles that matched what my images were doing. The thing is, if you switch x and y and negate y, <code>atan2(x,-y)==-atan2(y,x)</code>. One mistake had been incorrectly validated by yet another mistake, caused by <em>yet another mistake!</em></p><p>You see, by inverting those y coordinates, I was accidentally reversing the result of my rotation matrices, which caused them to rotate everything backwards. This was further complicated by how the camera rotates things - if your camera is fixed, how do you make it appear that it is rotating? You rotate everything else <em>in the opposite direction!</em> Hence even though my camera was rotating backwards despite looking like it was rotating forwards, it was actually being rotated the right way for the wrong reason.</p><p>While I initially thought the fix for this would require some crazy coordinate system juggling, the actual solution was fairly simple. The fact was, a coordinate system with z pointing into the screen and y pointing down <em>is still right-handed</em>, which means it should play nicely with rotations from a traditional right-handed system. Since the handedness of a coordinate system is largely determined by the perspective matrix, reversing y-coordinates in the drawing functions was actually reversing them too late in the pipeline. Hence, because I used <code>D3DXMatrixPerspectiveLH</code>, I had a left-handed coordinate system, and my rotations ended up being reversed. <code>D3DXMatrixPerspectiveRH</code> negates the z-coordinate to switch the handedness of the coordinate system, but I like positive z pointing into the screen, so I instead hacked the left-handed perspective matrix itself and negated the y-scaling parameter in cell [2,2], then undid all the y-coordinate inversion insanity that had been inside my drawing functions (you could also negate the y coordinate in any world transform matrix sufficiently early in the pipeline by specifying a negative y scaling in [2,2]). Suddenly everything was consistent, and rotations were happening in the right direction again. Now the Camera rotation actually required the negative rotation, as one would expect, and I still got to use a coordinate system with y pointing down. Unfortunately it also reversed several rotation operations throughout the engine, some of which were functions that had been returning the wrong value <em>this whole time</em> so as to match up with the incorrect rotation of the engine - something that will give me nightmares for weeks, probably involving a crazed rabbit hitting me over the head with a carrot screaming <em><strong>&ldquo;STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!"</strong></em></p><p>What's truly terrifying that all of this was indirectly caused by reversing the y coordinates in the first place. Had I instead flipped them in the perspective matrix itself (or otherwise properly transformed the coordinate system), I never would have had to deal with negating y coordinates, I never would have mistaken <code>atan2(x,-y)</code> as being valid, and I never would have had rotational issues in the first place.</p><p>All because of that one stupid tutorial.</p><p>P.S. the moral of the story isn't that tutorials are bad, it's that you shouldn't be a stupid dumbass and not write unit tests or look at function definitions.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-07-25T01:06:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/coordinate-systems-and-cascading/>July 25, 2012 at 1:06am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/coordinate-systems-and-cascading/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;1 comment</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcoordinate-systems-and-cascading%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Coordinate%20Systems%20And%20Cascading%20Stupidity&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcoordinate-systems-and-cascading%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcoordinate-systems-and-cascading%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/how-joysticks-ruined-my-graphics-engine/>How Joysticks Ruined My Graphics Engine</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>It's almost a tradition.</p><p>Every time my graphics engine has been stuck in maintenence mode for 6 months, I'll suddenly realize I need to push out an update or implement some new feature. I then realize that I haven't actually paid attention to any of my testing programs, or their speed, in months. This is followed by panic, as I discover my engine running at half speed, or worse. Having made an infinite number of tiny tweaks that all could have caused the problem, I am often thrown into temporary despair only to almost immediately find some incredibly stupid mistake that was causing it. One time it was because I left the profiler on. Another time it was caused by calling the Render function twice. I'm gearing up to release the <a href=http://blackspherestudios.com>first public beta</a> of my graphics engine, and this time is no different.</p><p>I find an old backup distribution of my graphics engine and run the tests, and my engine is running at 1100 FPS instead of 3000 or 4000 like it should be. Even the stress test is going at only ~110 FPS instead of 130 FPS. The strange part was that for the lightweight tests, it seemed to be hitting a wall at about 1100 FPS, whereas normally it hits a wall around 4000-5000 due to CPU⇒GPU bottlenecks. This is usually caused by some kind of debugging, so I thought I'd left the profiler on again, but no, it was off. After stepping through the rendering pipeline and finding nothing, I knew I had no chance of just guessing what the problem was, so I turned on the profiler and checked the results. Everything seemed relatively normal except-<pre class=language-cil><code>PlaneShader::cEngine::_callpresent       1.0    144.905 us   19%        145 us   19%
PlaneShader::cEngine::Update             1.0     12.334 us    2%        561 us   72%
PlaneShader::cEngine::FlushMessages    1.0    546.079 us   70%        549 us   71%
</code></pre><strong><em>What the FUCK?!</em></strong> Why is <em>70%</em> of my time being spent in <code>FlushMessages()</code>? All that does is process window messages! It shouldn't take any time at all, and here it is taking longer to process messages than it does to render an entire frame!<pre class=language-cpp><code>bool cEngine::FlushMessages()
{
PROFILE_FUNC();
_exactmousecalc();
//windows stuff
MSG msg;

while(PeekMessageW(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))
{
TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
DispatchMessageW(&amp;msg);

    if(msg.message == WM_QUIT)
    {
      _quit = true;
      return false;
    }

}

_joyupdateall();
return !_quit; //function returns opposite of quit
}
</code></pre>Bringing up the function, there don't seem to be many opportunities for it to fail. I go ahead and comment out <code>_exactmousecalc()</code> and <code>_joyupdateall()</code>, wondering if, perhaps, something in the joystick function was messing up? Lo and behold, my speeds are back to normal! After re-inserting the exact mouse calculation, it is, in fact, <code>_joyupdateall()</code> causing the problem. This is the start of the function:<pre class=language-cpp><code>void cInputManager::_joyupdateall()
{
JOYINFOEX info;
info.dwSize=sizeof(JOYINFOEX);
info.dwFlags= \[ Clipped... \];

for(unsigned short i = 0; i &lt; _maxjoy; ++i)
{
if(joyGetPosEx(i,&amp;info)==JOYERR_NOERROR)
{
if(_allbuttons\[i\]!=info.dwButtons)
{
</code></pre>Well, shit, there isn't really any possible explanation here other than <em>something</em> going wrong with <code>joyGetPosEx</code>. It turns out that calling <code>joyGetPosEx</code> when there isn't a joystick plugged in takes a whopping 34.13 µs (microseconds) on average, which is almost as long as it takes me to render a single frame (43.868 µs). There's probably a good reason for this, but evidently it is not good practice to call it unnecessarily. Fixing this was relatively easy - just force an explicit call to look for active joystick inputs and only poll those, but its still one of the weirdest performance bottlenecks I've come up against.</p><p>Of course, if you aren't developing a graphics engine, consider that 1/60 of a second is 16666 µs - 550 µs leaves a lot of breathing room for a game to work with, but a graphics engine must not force <em>any</em> unnecessary cost on to a program that is using it unless that program explicitly allows it, hence the problem.</p><p>Then again, <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1528727/why-is-sse-scalar-sqrtx-slower-than-rsqrtx-x>calculating invsqrt(x)*x is faster than sqrt(x)</a>, so I guess anything is possible.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-06-22T22:29:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-joysticks-ruined-my-graphics-engine/>June 22, 2012 at 10:29pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/how-joysticks-ruined-my-graphics-engine/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;2 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-joysticks-ruined-my-graphics-engine%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20Joysticks%20Ruined%20My%20Graphics%20Engine&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-joysticks-ruined-my-graphics-engine%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-joysticks-ruined-my-graphics-engine%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/properly-dreaming-about-success/>Properly Dreaming About Success</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>The wisdom of antiquity suggests that we must first imagine what we want to achieve if we are ever to succeed, but <a href=http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2011/06/08/visualize-success-if-you-want-to-fail/>science has other ideas</a>. A study demonstrated that visualizing yourself reaching a goal tricks your brain into thinking you actually did it, causing a relaxation response, which in turn robs you of ambition and energy.</p><p>This is a troubling counter-argument to age-old wisdom, but perhaps both sides can be right? I have been relentlessly pursuing the same goal for many years, and from my experience, it matters <em>what</em> you visualize just as much as <em>if</em>. In particular, one should imagine <strong>what you are actually trying to create</strong>, rather than what you would do with all your riches.</p><p>By coupling your imagination to your problem solving skills, you can draw a line between where you are now and what you need to do to make your vision come to life. This both solidifies your goals, highlights potential problem areas and outlines a clear plan of action, which helps <a href=http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/07/10/the-procrastinating-caveman-what-human-evolution-teaches-us-about-why-we-put-off-work-and-how-to-stop/>prevent procrastination</a> caused by not knowing what to do. Simply imagining that we are living the high life after hitting the big time, however, merely drains us of ambition by creating a false sense of accomplishment. You must visualize your finished creation, not the act of finishing it.</p><p>There is a marvelous, unspeakably beautiful thing that wanders around in my subconscious. Every now and then I am given another glimpse, or shown another spark of inspiration of this indescribable <em>vision</em> that seems so real and yet could not possibly be written about, because nothing like it has ever existed. It's like looking into a future that could arrive tomorrow if only I could bring it to life. Sometimes I wonder if I'm losing my way, only for something else to trigger another magnificent concept. It shows me why I can never give up, even it if takes me an eternity to craft my thoughts into a new reality.</p><p>Your imagination is a tool, and like any other, it can be used or abused. Wield it wisely.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-05-26T05:56:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/properly-dreaming-about-success/>May 26, 2012 at 5:56am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/properly-dreaming-about-success/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fproperly-dreaming-about-success%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Properly%20Dreaming%20About%20Success&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fproperly-dreaming-about-success%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fproperly-dreaming-about-success%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><div class=pager><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/15>Newer</a></li><li style=text-align:center><a href=/blog/>Home</a></li><li style=text-align:right><a href=/blog/page/17>Older</a></li></ul></div></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/>People Can't Care About Everything</a></li><li><a href=/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</a></li><li><a href=/blog/age-of-bullshit/>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</a></li><li><a href=/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
