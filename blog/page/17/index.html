Programming is very similar to architecture - both an art and a science. The comparison, however, falls apart when you complain about architecture and buildings having all these well-established best practices. The art of making buildings hasn't really changed all that much in the past 50 years. Programming didn't exist 50 years ago.</p><p>The fact is, we've been building buildings for <em>thousands of years</em>. We've been writing programs for around <em>40</em>, and in that period we have gone from computers the size of rooms to computers the size of watches. The instant we establish any sort of good practice, it's bulldozed by new technology. Many modern functional programming languages had to be updated to elegantly handle concurrency <em>at all</em>, and we've only just barely established the concept of worker threads for efficiently utilizing 4-8 cores as we step into the realm of CPU/GPU collision and the advent of massively parallel processing on a large scale, which once again renders standard concepts of programming obsolete. The fact that software runs at all is, quite simply, astonishing. Windows still has old DOS code dating back to the 1980s having repercussions in Windows 7 (You can't name a folder &ldquo;con&rdquo; because it was a <a href=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/22/55388.aspx>reserved device name</a> in DOS). If they were to completely rewrite the operating system now, it'll be completely obsolete in 20 years anyway and we'd be complaining about NT's lingering 32-bit compatibility issues and old functions not being threadsafe on a 128 core processor and problems <em>I can't even predict</em>.</p><p>Standards can't exist if we can't agree on the right way to do things, and in software development, we can't agree on the right way to do things because <em>nobody knows</em> (and if someone tells you they know, <em>they're lying</em>). Just as we all begin to start settling down on good practices, new technology changes the rules again. This further complicates things because we often forget exactly which parts of the technology are changing. There's a reason you write a kernel in C and not F#. Our processor architecture is the same fundamental concept it was almost 30 years ago. Ideally we would have moved away from complex instruction sets now that nobody uses them anymore, but we haven't even done that. Language fanboys forget this and insist that everything should be written in whatever their favorite language is, without having any idea what they're talking about. This results in a giant mess, with literally everyone telling everyone else they're doing it wrong.</p><p>That's the software industry today. It's where everyone says everyone else is wrong, because we have no goddamn idea what software development should be, because what software development should be <em>keeps changing</em>, and its changing so rapidly we can barely keep up, let alone actually settle on a bunch of standards. Instead, individual groups standardize themselves and you get a bunch of competing ecosystems each insisting they are right, without observing that they are all right at the same time - each standard is built to match the demands of not only <em>where</em>, but <em>when</em> it is being used.</p><p>Luckily, I don't program because I want to write programs all day. I program because I want to build something magnificent. If you make a living programming for a bunch of clients that try to tell you what to do and always say it should be faster and cheaper, well, <a href=http://clientsfromhell.net/>welcome to being an artist</a>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-05-07T01:12:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/standards-problem/>May 7, 2012 at 1:12am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/standards-problem/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;7 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fstandards-problem%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Standards%20Problem&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fstandards-problem%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fstandards-problem%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/an-evidence-based-refutation-of-the-project-glass-parodies/>An evidence-based refutation of the Project Glass parodies</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><hr><p>It seems like half of the internet is complaining about Google's new wearable computers. They say that they're distracting, they say that you can't see through them, and they ask why you would want to be hooked into the internet like that in the first place. However, all of the basic usability complaints are built on critically unsound foundations: none of the complainers have used one of the devices. I've at least tried the technology<sup><a href=#f1>1</a></sup>, and I have some facts and some ten-second experiments that I hope will address the more common concerns.</p><h5 id=obstructed-vision>Obstructed Vision</h5><p>We'll begin with the claim that head-mounted displays would obstruct the wearer's vision. This is the most common argument of the parody videos that spread like wildfire immediately after the announcement. All of them go wrong before they start, mostly because they fail to consider the fundamental differences between the human eye and the recorded video used to make the announcement. Here are a few of the ways in which this difference is important.</p><p>First, people are already missing huge chunks of their visual field. To start with, your brain only really pays attention to your <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea>foveal region</a>, which is about the size of your thumb at arm's length. On top of that, most adults have <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater>floaters</a>, and everybody has the high-school-science &ldquo;blind spot&rdquo; where the eye's neurons displace actual sensing elements<sup><a href=#f2>2</a></sup>. Add in your nose, eye socket, hair, and sunglasses, and your brain is continually compensating for large portions of your visual field being useless. Since the icons presented by Project Glass are in the region occluded by hair and eyebrows, you won't even notice them unless you go looking for the interface.</p><p>Secondly, and more interestingly, your cell phone makes you go blind every time you look at it.<sup><a href=http://jp.physoc.org/content/151/2/285.full.pdf>[pdf]</a></sup> The problem is focal length. It takes nearly half a second for the human eye to change its focus from something on the horizon to something at arm's length, during which time you see just as much (or as little) as you do during a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccadic_masking>saccade</a>. The trick here is that an HMD can be calibrated to appear as if it's way far away, so your eye can view its image without having to waste time bending lenses around. The effect, when experienced in person, is somewhat striking.</p><p>The third fact that this argument misses is more important still. You have two eyes, but Project Glass is only on one of them! In order to convey how critical this omission is, I want you to conduct a short experiment. First, hold up your left hand. Second, cover your left eye using your left hand. Third, continue reading.</p><h5 id=texting-while-walking>Texting While Walking</h5><p>The next major complaint is that the glasses will present a crippling distraction. I'll agree that the glasses will be distracting, but I'm equally sure that they'll be less of a distraction than people think.</p><p>The big thing this argument forgets is that people are actually pretty good at being distracted. Next time you're at the grocery store, count how many times you look down to read your shopping list while you're still moving. While you're walking down the street, pay attention to how often you look at things around you - eye-catching passersby, nice clothing in storefronts, birds flying across the edges of your vision, and so on. Count how many people you see with their noses buried in their book or their phone while they walk. Compared to all this, getting an email really isn't that much of a problem.</p><p><a href=http://www.sciencephoto.com/image/349511/530wm/T4200406-Wearable_computer-SPL.jpg><img style=float:right src=http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/9452/t4200406wearablecompute.th.jpg title="Thed Starner" alt="Wearable Computer"></a>I'll even provide some direct evidence that HMDs aren't distracting. The guy in the picture at right is Thad Starner. He's been wearing a head-mounted display continuously since 1993; he's also been deeply involved in Project Glass for a while. Unlike Project Glass, though, his HMD displays a full 1024x768 computer screen with an internet connection, a browser, and Emacs - far more distracting than Google's streamlined interface. I work with some of his students and talk to him occasionally, so I can tell you one thing: he doesn't run into walls very often.</p><p>Of course, &ldquo;doesn't run into walls very often&rdquo; isn't exactly a scientific measurement, so Dr. Starner has gone ahead and done some research.<sup><a href=http://dmrussell.net/CHI2010/docs/p1695.pdf>[pdf]</a></sup> In particular, he and his colleagues gave some german students a shelf full of bins and a series of orders to place. Some students were given lists of items on paper, others were given pictures of which bin to grab items from, others were given orders over an earphone, and the final group was shown the order on a head-mounted display. Despite having an image floating right in front of them, HMD-equipped users completed their tasks with a third as many errors and about fifteen seconds faster than their competitors. Head-mounted displays aren't distracting; if anything, they're <em>less</em> of a problem than the average intrusion.</p><h5 id=too-connected-to-think>Too Connected to Think</h5><p>The final argument, and possibly the most important, is that a permanent internet connection is bad. As you might expect, I believe exactly the opposite.</p><p>Put simply, we use computers enough that we've become used to them, not only habitually, but in that our brains have physically shifted around to work with them. <a href=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6043/776.short>Research</a><sup><a href=http://www.uvm.edu/~cmplxsys/newsevents/pdfs/2011/google-effects-on-memory.pdf>[pdf]</a></sup> shows that, if given some information and induced to memorize either the information itself or where it can be found, people are much better at remembering where information can be found. We've all observed this firsthand. We remember the name of the page on Wikipedia rather than its contents, we remember the name of the function or the class rather than its signature and we look it up in the documentation, and so on.</p><p>We're well on our way towards Charles Stross's &ldquo;posthuman genius loci of the net&rdquo;, where a person's computer contains so much information that forced separation results in crippling amnesia. As another experiment, I challenge you to remember more than half of your address book, email or phone number or snail-mail, without using your computer. To recall a definition, a cyborg is &ldquo;a person who is part machine&rdquo;. Not a human body with robot bits, but a <em>person</em>, a self-aware consciousness, which leans on computers to do some of its work. We are all cyborgs. Project Glass simply makes it harder for us to lose our machine halves or drop them in the toilet.</p><p>Given that, why is there so much naysaying in the first place? You already have a laptop or a smartphone that organizes your pictures, navigates for you, handles your calendar and your address book, and (by way of Wikipedia) remembers the capital of Albania so you don't have to. Most of you have it with you 24/7. I simply don't understand the objection to making it more powerful and easier to use. I make my computer handle as much of my life as it can; when I'm not doing arithmetic, I can be doing calculus, and when I'm not trying to remember someone's phone number, I can be talking with them about the meaning of life. My computer makes me a better human because it gives me the freedom to exercise my rationality and consciousness. Project Glass is something I welcome. It helps me be human even when I'm not sitting at my desk.</p><p><sup><a name=f1>1</a></sup> <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_retinal_display>Virtual Retina Display</a></p><p><sup><a name=f2>2</a></sup> <a href=http://www.vonrechenberg.ch/blindspots.html>Demonstration</a></p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-04-15T23:40:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/an-evidence-based-refutation-of-the-project-glass-parodies/>April 15, 2012 at 11:40pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/an-evidence-based-refutation-of-the-project-glass-parodies/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fan-evidence-based-refutation-of-the-project-glass-parodies%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=An%20evidence-based%20refutation%20of%20the%20Project%20Glass%20parodies&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fan-evidence-based-refutation-of-the-project-glass-parodies%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fan-evidence-based-refutation-of-the-project-glass-parodies%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/language-wars-are-pointless/>Language Wars Are Pointless</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Sometimes it really amazes me when anyone actually takes language wars seriously. If I casually mention &ldquo;pointless language wars&rdquo; and someone leaves a comment ignoring my entire blog post, informing me that language wars are not pointless, I seriously question their priorities (and possibly their sanity).</p><p>Oh, was I not clear enough before? <em>Language wars are pointless</em>. They are pointless for 2 reasons: You are never actually arguing about the language, only design philosophies, and these language wars invariably disregard context, which makes all results of said war <em>completely meaningless</em>.</p><p>In <a href=http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/>this crazy rant</a> Alex Munroe<sup><a href=#f1>1</a></sup> made about PHP being a terrible language, he seems to be confusing &ldquo;PHP is a bad language&rdquo; and &ldquo;PHP adheres to bad design philosophies&rdquo;, and even then its just design philosophies he doesn't agree with. This is all well and good, but <em>that doesn't make PHP a bad language</em>. It's like saying a hammer is bad because you don't like the handle - just because its not good for <em>you</em> doesn't mean its not good for <em>everyone</em>. If you want to prove that PHP is fundamentally a bad language, you have to demonstrate that almost all the philosophies that it follows are bad for <strong>everyone</strong>. You can't say a philosophy is good in one language and not good in another without accidentally tripping over <em>yet another</em> philosophy. A good example is his complaint about the &lsquo;@&rsquo; operator suppressing errors. You can suppress errors in python too, its just harder. The argument is that its too easy to ignore errors, therefore it encourages bad programming, therefore PHP is the devil. This doesn't make sense, because you aren't saying <em>PHP itself</em> is bad, you are saying that you believe a programming language should make writing bad code difficult, which is a <em>philosophy</em>. Consequently, you can't just say that PHP is bad, you have to say that every single language that does this is at least partially bad. Of course, the guy loves writing code in perl, so I suppose he prefers using a language that makes it hard to do <em>anything</em>.<sup><a href=#f2>2</a></sup></p><p>Let's say you actually prove that something is bad for everyone. Have you proven that its bad for everyone <em>in every possible context?</em> You have to do that too. The problem with language wars is that people go <em>&ldquo;Yo man whatcha using PHP for we got dis new trunk called Django that's so wicked sick goddamn get with the times homie&rdquo;</em> without ever actually asking you <strong>what you are trying to do</strong> and in <strong>what context you are doing it in</strong>. You cannot critique a language without first specifying what <em>context</em> you are critiquing it in. If you do not specify the context, even if its something vague like &ldquo;for most non-performance critical applications&rdquo;, everything you say is an over-generalization and therefore <em>invalid</em>. There is quite literally <em>NOTHING</em> that you can absolutely guarantee any piece of code should do - not even the fact that it should <em>work</em> (for example, testing static code analysis). Because of this, unless you are saying <code>X</code> is a bad language for doing <code>Y</code>, and not simply that a given language is bad, forever, no matter what, you are doing a bad job of critiquing. Even <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck>brainfuck</a> is useful for illustrating <a href=http://www.damow.net/2011/09/30/brainfuck-revisited-turing-machines/screen-shot-2011-10-01-at-00-41-45/>how a Turing Machine works</a>. As the old saying goes, never say never (or always).</p><p>With this said, most of the points Alex Munroe makes against PHP are actually quite valid.<sup><a href=#f3>3</a></sup> In fact, if he had instead argued that PHP is a poor choice of language for building a modern, professional website, I'd probably agree &mldr;but that doesn't make it a bad language. Maybe its a bad language <strong>for that purpose</strong>, but that's as far as you can go and still hold a legitimate opinion. There is an endless, <em>endless</em> torrent of people insisting that C++ is a terrible language, and it's not that their reasons are wrong, it's that they are ignoring the <em>context</em> of what I use C++ for. It just follows design philosophies they don't agree with in <em>their line of work</em>. It's fine that they don't agree with them, but uh, that's why we have lots of different programming languages and why we need to <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/new-post/>stop assuming programmers are all the same</a>. What are you going to do, tell Linus Torvalds to code Linux using Lisp instead of C because Performance Doesn't Matter?</p><p>This problem of blindly following idioms like &ldquo;Performance Doesn't Matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;SHARD EVERYTHING&rdquo; in the database world is that you are <strong>separating the advice from the context it was given in</strong>. This makes language wars pointless and causes serious issues with the new wave of databases that are pissing off a lot of people (<a href=http://www.xtranormal.com/watch/6995033/mongo-db-is-web-scale>BUT MONDODB IS WEB SCALE</a>) because fanboys who don't understand the <em>context</em> those databases were designed for simply assume you should use them for <em>everything</em> and therefore anyone using MySQL or PostgreSQL is a dinosaur. You can't just forget about <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns>Unknown unknowns</a> (things you don't know that you don't know). If someone is using a language and you don't understand why, don't assume its because they're an idiot because the language is bad no matter what, assume that its because there is a variable you forgot to account for.</p><p>It's kind of like watching a carpenter yell at a plumber for building a house upside-down, except the plumber actually built a toilet and the carpenter just thinks it looks like an upside-down house.</p><span style=font-size:80%><br><sup><a name=f1>1</a></sup> whose name took me almost 2 minutes of digging around his blog, and then his site, until I finally found it buried in the fine print on the footer.</span></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-04-10T17:48:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/language-wars-are-pointless/>April 10, 2012 at 5:48pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/language-wars-are-pointless/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;2 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2flanguage-wars-are-pointless%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Language%20Wars%20Are%20Pointless&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2flanguage-wars-are-pointless%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2flanguage-wars-are-pointless%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/why-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong/>Why Windows 8 Does The Right Thing The Wrong Way</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Yesterday, I saw a superb presentation called &ldquo;<a href=http://www.slideshare.net/bcousins/when-the-consoles-die-what-comes-next>When The Consoles Die, What Comes Next?</a>&rdquo; by Ben Cousins. It demonstrates that mobile gaming is behaving as a disruptive technology, and is causing the same market decline in consoles that consoles themselves did to arcades in the 1990s. He also demonstrates how TV crushed cinema in a similar manner - we just don't think of it like that because we don't remember back when almost <strong>60% of the population</strong> was going to the movie theaters on a weekly basis. Today, most people tend to go to the movie theater as a special occasion, so the theaters didn't completely die out, they just lost their market dominance. The role the movie theater played changed as new technology was introduced.</p><p>The game industry, and in fact the software industry as a whole, is in a similar situation. Due to the mass adoption of iPads and other tablets, we now have a mobile computing experience that is distinct from that of say, a console, or even a PC. Consequently, the role of consoles and PCs will shift in response to this new technology. However, while many people are eager to jump on the bandwagon (and it's a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds>very lucrative bandwagon</a>), we are already losing sight of what will happen to stabilize the market.</p><p>People who want to sound futuristic and smart are talking about the &ldquo;Post-PC Era&rdquo;, which is a very inaccurate thing to say. PCs are clearly very useful for some tasks, and its unlikely that they will be entirely replaced by mobile computing, especially when screen real-estate is so important to development and productivity, and the difficulty of replicating an ergonomic keyboard. The underlying concept of a PC, in that you sit down at it, have a keyboard and mouse and a large screen to work at, is unlikely to change significantly. The mouse will probably be replaced by adaptive touch solutions and possibly gestures, and the screen might very well turn into a giant glass slab with OLEDs on it, or perhaps simply exist as the wall, but the underlying idea is not going anywhere. It will simply <em>evolve</em>.</p><p>Windows 8 is both a surprisingly prescient move on part of Microsoft, and also (not surprisingly) a horrible train wreck of an OS. The key concept that Microsoft correctly anticipated was the <strong>unification of operating systems</strong>. It is foolish to think that we will continue on with this brick wall separating tablet devices and PCs. The difference between tablets and PCs is simply one of both user interface and user experience. These are both managed by the highest layers of complexity in an operating system, such that it can simply adapt its presentation to suit whatever device it is currently on. It will <em>have to</em> once we introduce monitors the size of walls and OLED cards with embedded microchips. There will be such a ridiculous number of possible presentation mediums, that the idea of a presentation medium must be generalized such that a single operating system can operate on a stupendous range of devices.</p><p>This has important consequences for the future of software. Currently we seem to think that there should be &ldquo;tablet versions&rdquo; of software. This is silly and inconvenient. If you buy a piece of software, it should <strong>just work</strong>, no matter what you put it on. If it finds itself on a PC, it will analyze the screen size and behave appropriately. If its on a tablet, it will enable touch controls and reorganize the UI appropriately. More importantly, you shouldn't have to <em>buy</em> a version for each of your devices, because eventually there won't be anything other than a computer we carry around with us that plugs into terminals or interacts with small central servers at a company.</p><p>If someone buys a game I make, they <em>own</em> a copy of that game. That means they need to be able to get a copy of that game on all their devices without having to buy it 2 or 3 times. The act of buying the game should make it available to install on any interactive medium they want, and my game should simply adapt itself to whatever medium is being used to play it. The difference between PC and tablet will become blurred as they are reduced to simply being different modes of interaction, with the same underlying functionality.</p><p>This is what Microsoft is attempting to anticipate, by building an operating system that can work on both a normal computer and a tablet. They even introduce a Windows App Store, which is a crucial step towards allowing you to buy a program for both your PC and your tablet <em>in a single purchase</em>. Unfortunately, the train-wreck analogy is all too appropriate for describing the state of Windows 8. Rather than presenting an elegant, unified tablet and PC experience, they smash together two completely incompatible interfaces in an incoherent disaster. You are either presented with a metro interface, or a traditional desktop interface, with no in-between. The transition is about as smooth as your head smashing against a brick wall. They don't even properly account for the fact that their new metro start menu is terribly optimized for a mouse, but try to make you use it anyway. It does the right thing, the wrong way.</p><p>The game industry has yet to catch on to this, since one designs either a &ldquo;PC game&rdquo; or a &ldquo;mobile game&rdquo;. When a game is released on a tablet, it's a special &ldquo;mobile version&rdquo;. FL Studio has a special mobile version. There is no unification anywhere, and the two are treated as separate walled gardens. While this is currently an advantage during a time where tablets don't have the kind of power a PC does, it will quickly become a disadvantage. The convenience of having familiar interfaces on all your devices, with all of the same programs, will trump isolated functionality. There will always be games and programs more suited to consoles, or to PCs, or to tablets, but unless we stop thinking of these as separate devices, and instead one of many possible user experiences that we must adapt our creations to, we will find ourselves on the wrong side of history.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-03-14T14:28:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong/>March 14, 2012 at 2:28pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/why-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;10 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why%20Windows%208%20Does%20The%20Right%20Thing%20The%20Wrong%20Way&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/well-that-was-interesting/>Well That Was Interesting</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>So today I go to an orthodontist appointment at 11:30 AM, and its bright and sunny out, but fairly breezy. Several hours later I leave for a final exam for CSE 373 at the UW. Still nice and sunny out, but also still very breezy. We start the exam, and 40 minutes in, the power cuts out and we're put into pitch blackness. A few seconds later, I can hear a generator hum to life and the power is suddenly back on.</p><p>10 minutes later, it happened again, as I heard the dying groans of the generator failing. For a few confused minutes, students used their cellphones to try and work on the test, until the evacuation alarm sounded.

I realize I don't actually know what happens when a final gets cancelled.
