It demonstrates that mobile gaming is behaving as a disruptive technology, and is causing the same market decline in consoles that consoles themselves did to arcades in the 1990s. He also demonstrates how TV crushed cinema in a similar manner - we just don't think of it like that because we don't remember back when almost <strong>60% of the population</strong> was going to the movie theaters on a weekly basis. Today, most people tend to go to the movie theater as a special occasion, so the theaters didn't completely die out, they just lost their market dominance. The role the movie theater played changed as new technology was introduced.</p><p>The game industry, and in fact the software industry as a whole, is in a similar situation. Due to the mass adoption of iPads and other tablets, we now have a mobile computing experience that is distinct from that of say, a console, or even a PC. Consequently, the role of consoles and PCs will shift in response to this new technology. However, while many people are eager to jump on the bandwagon (and it's a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds>very lucrative bandwagon</a>), we are already losing sight of what will happen to stabilize the market.</p><p>People who want to sound futuristic and smart are talking about the &ldquo;Post-PC Era&rdquo;, which is a very inaccurate thing to say. PCs are clearly very useful for some tasks, and its unlikely that they will be entirely replaced by mobile computing, especially when screen real-estate is so important to development and productivity, and the difficulty of replicating an ergonomic keyboard. The underlying concept of a PC, in that you sit down at it, have a keyboard and mouse and a large screen to work at, is unlikely to change significantly. The mouse will probably be replaced by adaptive touch solutions and possibly gestures, and the screen might very well turn into a giant glass slab with OLEDs on it, or perhaps simply exist as the wall, but the underlying idea is not going anywhere. It will simply <em>evolve</em>.</p><p>Windows 8 is both a surprisingly prescient move on part of Microsoft, and also (not surprisingly) a horrible train wreck of an OS. The key concept that Microsoft correctly anticipated was the <strong>unification of operating systems</strong>. It is foolish to think that we will continue on with this brick wall separating tablet devices and PCs. The difference between tablets and PCs is simply one of both user interface and user experience. These are both managed by the highest layers of complexity in an operating system, such that it can simply adapt its presentation to suit whatever device it is currently on. It will <em>have to</em> once we introduce monitors the size of walls and OLED cards with embedded microchips. There will be such a ridiculous number of possible presentation mediums, that the idea of a presentation medium must be generalized such that a single operating system can operate on a stupendous range of devices.</p><p>This has important consequences for the future of software. Currently we seem to think that there should be &ldquo;tablet versions&rdquo; of software. This is silly and inconvenient. If you buy a piece of software, it should <strong>just work</strong>, no matter what you put it on. If it finds itself on a PC, it will analyze the screen size and behave appropriately. If its on a tablet, it will enable touch controls and reorganize the UI appropriately. More importantly, you shouldn't have to <em>buy</em> a version for each of your devices, because eventually there won't be anything other than a computer we carry around with us that plugs into terminals or interacts with small central servers at a company.</p><p>If someone buys a game I make, they <em>own</em> a copy of that game. That means they need to be able to get a copy of that game on all their devices without having to buy it 2 or 3 times. The act of buying the game should make it available to install on any interactive medium they want, and my game should simply adapt itself to whatever medium is being used to play it. The difference between PC and tablet will become blurred as they are reduced to simply being different modes of interaction, with the same underlying functionality.</p><p>This is what Microsoft is attempting to anticipate, by building an operating system that can work on both a normal computer and a tablet. They even introduce a Windows App Store, which is a crucial step towards allowing you to buy a program for both your PC and your tablet <em>in a single purchase</em>. Unfortunately, the train-wreck analogy is all too appropriate for describing the state of Windows 8. Rather than presenting an elegant, unified tablet and PC experience, they smash together two completely incompatible interfaces in an incoherent disaster. You are either presented with a metro interface, or a traditional desktop interface, with no in-between. The transition is about as smooth as your head smashing against a brick wall. They don't even properly account for the fact that their new metro start menu is terribly optimized for a mouse, but try to make you use it anyway. It does the right thing, the wrong way.</p><p>The game industry has yet to catch on to this, since one designs either a &ldquo;PC game&rdquo; or a &ldquo;mobile game&rdquo;. When a game is released on a tablet, it's a special &ldquo;mobile version&rdquo;. FL Studio has a special mobile version. There is no unification anywhere, and the two are treated as separate walled gardens. While this is currently an advantage during a time where tablets don't have the kind of power a PC does, it will quickly become a disadvantage. The convenience of having familiar interfaces on all your devices, with all of the same programs, will trump isolated functionality. There will always be games and programs more suited to consoles, or to PCs, or to tablets, but unless we stop thinking of these as separate devices, and instead one of many possible user experiences that we must adapt our creations to, we will find ourselves on the wrong side of history.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-03-14T14:28:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong/>March 14, 2012 at 2:28pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/why-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;10 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why%20Windows%208%20Does%20The%20Right%20Thing%20The%20Wrong%20Way&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-windows-8-does-right-thing-wrong%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/well-that-was-interesting/>Well That Was Interesting</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>So today I go to an orthodontist appointment at 11:30 AM, and its bright and sunny out, but fairly breezy. Several hours later I leave for a final exam for CSE 373 at the UW. Still nice and sunny out, but also still very breezy. We start the exam, and 40 minutes in, the power cuts out and we're put into pitch blackness. A few seconds later, I can hear a generator hum to life and the power is suddenly back on.</p><p>10 minutes later, it happened again, as I heard the dying groans of the generator failing. For a few confused minutes, students used their cellphones to try and work on the test, until the evacuation alarm sounded. I hung around outside the building for a good 20 minutes before the professor finally cancelled the final outright due to extraneous circumstances. I realize I don't actually know what happens when a final gets cancelled. Note that it is still warm and sunny outside, just very windy.</p><p>So, I go home on the bus, and things get a bit overcast, but nothing major. Then I get back to Redmond and the whole town is in the middle of a goddamn blizzard, which I then had to drive through back from the Park & Ride to get to my house.

When the desaturated VS11 beta came out, <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/implicit-ui-design/>I hated the color scheme</a> but decided I still wanted the upgraded components, so I went to install VS11 beta. Unfortunately the beta only lets you change its install location if the preview developer preview isn't installed, and the developer preview had installed itself into C:\ without ever letting me change the path, which was annoying. So I took the opportunity to fix things and uninstalled the developer preview, then installed the beta of VS11.</p><p>Everything was fine and dandy until I discovered that VS11 wasn't compiling C++ DLLs that worked on XP. I don't know how it managed to do this, since the DLL had no dependencies whatsoever, and that bug was only supposed to affect MFC and other windows related components and hence there was no windows flag for me to specify which version I wanted, but just to be sure I decided to try and compile it in VS2010. It was at this point I discovered that VS2010 could no longer open any projects at all. It was broken. Further investigation revealed that uninstalling VS11 developer preview will break VS2010. Now, I had an ultimate version of VS2010 I've had sitting around for a while I got from Dreamspark, so I figured I could just uninstall VS2010 and then reinstall the ultimate version and that would kill any remaining problems the pesky 2011 beta introduced.</p><p>The thing is, I can't uninstall the SP1 update from VS2010. Not before I uninstalled VS2010, not after I uninstalled it, not even after I installed the ultimate version. It just gave me this:</p><p>So I just had to leave the Service Pack alone and attempted to re-apply it after installing VS2010 Ultimate, but the online installer failed. So then I downloaded the SP1 iso file and installed that. It failed too, but this time I could fix the problem - someone had forgotten to copy the F#_redist MSI file to the TEMP directory, instead only copying the CAB file. Note that I don't even have F# installed.</p><p>I was able to resolve that problem and finished installing the service pack, but to no avail. Both the VS2010 installation and the service pack had forgotten to install the C++ standard library headers, which, as you can imagine, are kind of important. I searched around for a solution, but the only guy who had the same problem as me had simply <a href=http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/pl/vssetup/thread/86743068-8e78-4f20-bb3e-44ff0e5170c0>reformatted and reinstalled windows</a> (note the moderator's excellent grasp of english grammar). The only thing I had to go off of was using a <a href=http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2010uninstall>special utility</a> they built to uninstall all traces of VS2010 from your computer. Unfortunately, the utility doesn't actually succeed in uninstalling everything, and also doesn't uninstall SP1, so you have to uninstall SP1 first before running the utility. The problem is, I can't uninstall SP1 or I'll never be able to install it again.</p><p>At this point it appears I am pretty much fucked. How does Microsoft consider this an acceptable scenario? I worked as an intern at Microsoft once, I <em>know</em> they use their own development tools. I used tools that hadn't even been released yet. There was one guy on our team whose entire job was just the setup. And yet, through a series of astonishingly bad failures, any one of which being fixed would have prevented this scenario, my computer is now apparently fucked, and I'm going to have to upgrade my windows installation to 64 bit a lot sooner than I wanted.</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After using the uninstall tool to do a full uninstall and uninstalling SP1 and manually finding any VC10 related registry entries in the registry and deleting them, then reinstalling everything from scratch, I solved the header file problem (but had to reinstall SP1 or it wouldn't let me open my project files). However then the broken VCTargetsPath problem showed up again, which a repair didn't fix. I finally fixed the issue by finding someone else with a working installation of VC10, having them export their MSBuild registry key and manually merging it into my registry. If you have this problem, I've uploaded the registry key (which should be the same for any system, XP or 7) <a href=http://www.mediafire.com/?91yph5n2704hvzi>here</a>. If you have a 64-bit machine, you may need to copy its values into the corresponding WoW64 nodes (just search for a second instance of MSBuild in your registry).</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-03-10T16:22:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/visual-studio-broke-my-computer/>March 10, 2012 at 4:22pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/visual-studio-broke-my-computer/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;2 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fvisual-studio-broke-my-computer%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Visual%20Studio%20Broke%20My%20Computer&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fvisual-studio-broke-my-computer%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fvisual-studio-broke-my-computer%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/hiring-wrong-people/>Hiring the Wrong People</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Several years ago, <a href=http://antitrust.slated.org/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/7000/PX07199.pdf>this famous rant</a> by Bill Gates (here's a <a href=http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2008/06/24/full-text-an-epic-bill-gates-e-mail-rant/>more readable version</a>) made its way around the internet. What was remarkable about it was that Bill Gates himself flaming his underlings for many of the things everyone else was complaining about did almost nothing to improve Windows. What improvements were eventually made are usually attributed to many outside influences, especially Apple and the rise of tablet PCs.</p><p>This really isn't that remarkable to anyone inside the software industry. I've been an intern at Microsoft and I've seen all sorts of hilariously misconstrued practices and rules and regulations meant to bend employees into some magical definition of an awesome developer that is usually, itself, hopelessly misguided. Almost the entire modern business world runs on the idea that you hire someone and then tell them how to behave. It's an authoritarian mindset derived from the idea that employees should be obedient little robots. You hire managers to manage the employees, and when you have too many managers you hire department heads to manage the managers, and so on.</p><p>This is not how you manage creative people. Creative people should not be told what to do, only be given a general direction to walk in. You should hire a creative person because you want him to do what he was doing anyway. If your operating system is bloated, then hire someone who thinks that it shouldn't be bloated. You don't have to <em>TELL</em> that employee to make the operating system less bloated because they <em>want</em> it to be less bloated, so they'll just make it less bloated. If you don't trust them to do a good job making the operating system less bloated <em>you shouldn't hire them</em>.</p><p>In this context, the entire modern concept of a CEO driving the direction of a corporation breaks down. You do not drive the direction of a company by telling employees what to think. You drive the direction of a company by <em>hiring people who think in the direction you want to go</em>. Creative people work best when you simply <em>let them do their jobs</em>.</p><p>If you hire a web designer, you don't tell them what to do. You tell them what the end goal is, what the restrictions are, and let them figure out the best way to do it. The entire concept of a CEO going through potential website designs until he finds one he &ldquo;likes&rdquo; is utterly ridiculous since <em>you just hired them because they know that!</em> A situation where a manager can do an employee's job better than they can is extremely rare, because the people who tend to be the best at doing something are the people who are actually doing it. Just let them <em>do the job you hired them to do</em>.</p><p>If you hire a programmer to write a graphics engine, you don't tell them what order to implement features in. You don't even tell them what features you want them to implement, because someone <em>else</em> on your artistic team is supposed to know which features are needed, and the programmer is expected to prioritize those features properly because <em>that's what you freaking hired them for</em>.</p><p>If I hire an artist/designer to make a game, I expect them to go and make the game. I give them certain limitations, like budget concerns or maximum development time, but I expect them to be able to work within these restrictions or I <em>wouldn't have hired them in the first place</em>. If they don't, I don't hire a manager to make sure they do, I <strong>fire them</strong> (or move them somewhere else) because <em>they aren't doing their job</em>. The only time you need a manager is when there is a conflict of interest in the workplace or someone is actually doing something wrong. If most modern software companies have managers managing people day in and day out, then apparently those companies think that an employee is doing something wrong <em>every single day</em>. If an employee is doing something wrong every single day, <em>why did you hire them?</em></p><p>Even worse is that software companies do not consider themselves bastions of creativity. This is a problem, because software companies benefit greatly from this, since programmers tend to be naturally self-driven. A team working on a project simply needs a designated team leader to keep things focused, not a full-time manager, and the team leader definitely shouldn't be spending his entire day attending meetings (<strong>cough<em>Microsoft</em>cough</strong>). It's the team's project. <em>They</em> decide where it should go, and if this is a problem then you shouldn't have hired them. Google is an example of a software company leaning in this direction.</p><p>Creative companies need to trust their employees. Managers exist because employers don't trust employees. Software companies don't realize they're actually creative companies, and their employees hate this because the managers usually have no bloody idea what they're talking about, and we see examples of this over and over and over in the news and laugh at them. But we never actually look at it as a problem that needs to be fixed, only as an inevitability.</p><p>We can fix this. In fact, it was fixed almost a decade ago. Valve has no managers. There's just Gabe Newell and then everyone else. <em>It works</em>. If you happen to like Portal, I think you'd agree that it works <em>really damn well</em>. There is a significant chunk of the workforce that is not being utilized. The companies that do manage to utilize it are the ones that write the history books.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-02-29T17:21:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/hiring-wrong-people/>February 29, 2012 at 5:21pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/hiring-wrong-people/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhiring-wrong-people%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hiring%20the%20Wrong%20People&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhiring-wrong-people%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhiring-wrong-people%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/chill-out/>Chill Out</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>I do not usually involve myself with politics and bureaucracies, but they have a way of creeping into every facet of human experience in an almost parasitic manner. Even in my own profession of software engineering I have to deal with pointless language wars, followed by people being pissed off that I called them pointless. Well then, let me be perfectly clear here: Language wars are pointless. You know what else is pointless? Racism is pointless, sexism is pointless, rape culture is pointless, homophobia is pointless, religious dogma is pointless, and pretty much <em>every single topic in modern politics</em> is pointless, either by virtue of simply being ridiculous or by completely missing the point.</p><p>What bothers me about homophobia is twofold. One, obviously, is that it involves a religious person telling two people they can't fall in love with each other because whatever god they happen to worship says so, as if they actually have the authority to tell two adults what to do. If those two adults choose to go to hell, <a href=http://thedailybibleverse.blogspot.com/2009/07/ephesians-432-be-kind-and-compassionate.html>your own goddamn bible</a> says you're supposed to be nice to them anyway. But what's really disturbing is the fact that anyone even gives a shit about any of this. A dude wants to marry a dude, and this supposedly destroys the sanctity of marriage. I think you people are a tad bit sheltered, because there are <a href=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/22083762/ns/today-today_people/t/sex-slaves-human-trafficking-america/#.T0wA_IcgehZ>teenage girls being sold into slavery</a>, in a sex-trafficking ring, <em>in America</em>. I think, just maybe, you need to <strong>chill out</strong>, because being <em>sold into slavery</em> seems a lot worse than two guys kissing.</p><p>Then we have people who don't believe in woman's rights, or are still opposed to inter-racial marriage, as accounted by Kevin Roose in his book <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Unlikely-Disciple-Semester-Americas-University/dp/044617842X>&ldquo;The Unlikely Disciple&rdquo;</a>. These people <em>actually care</em> about trying to restrict woman from working or stopping inter-racial marriage. We have people campaigning against contraception and abortions at the same time without thinking about the difference between <a href=http://www.marco.org/2012/02/25/right-vs-pragmatic>being right and being pragmatic</a>. What about kids dying of thirst in Africa? What about the tyrannical despots still in control of various middle-eastern nations? What about China's one-child policy? What about malaria epidemics in South America?</p><p>What happened to all the <em>hard</em> problems?</p><p>Why would anyone even care about <a href=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2017607321_apasafghanistan.html>burning a book</a>? And why would some people proceed to laugh at the Taliban for doing that and then get pissed off about gay marriage? Do they simply not understand what being a hypocrite means? Why is it that the word &ldquo;sheeple&rdquo;, once used only by conspiracy theorist lunatics, now seems to describe Americans with disturbing accuracy? Has Facebook so changed our lives that we are now too incensed about a bunch of completely irrelevant topics that we forget about doing anything that actually has meaning? Have we <em>ever</em> actually cared about things that really matter?</p><p>In the late 1960s, America <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program>had a purpose</a> (so did <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_program>Russia</a>). It is sad that we apparently require a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War>war</a> that threatens our livelihood to get us to think logically for 5 seconds, and even then this was in the middle of the civil rights movement - so even in our one moment of glory, we were still being assholes. Now America is so powerful it faces no existential threat, and has predictably devolved into a bunch of <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/santorum-on-obama-what-a-snob-129/2012/02/27/gIQA99rDeR_video.html>bickering toddlers</a> (who are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PAJNntoRgA">still assholes</a>).</p><p>The future has not turned into 1984, nor does it involve flying cars. Instead, it is a strange amalgamation of realities, fused into a giant mess we call modern life. Facebook is still dependent on a 40 year old internet backbone. 95% of all modern software is crap and inherently dependent on code written several decades ago. We haven't solved world hunger, or moved to electronic credits, or colonized the moon, or hell even gotten back to the moon at all. We're too busy arguing about celebrities and gay marriage and religious books and a whole bunch of <em>meaningless crap</em>. We have failed to give our kids any sort of perspective, or priority. People do not understand the importance of compromise and instead criticize our president for <a href=http://www.pri.org/stories/politics-society/live-video-obama-expected-to-propose-compromise-on-contraceptive-coverage-8396.html>trying to get things done</a>. We seriously complain about our president doing exactly what politicians are supposed to do - compromise! We argue about teaching evolution in school, we argue about being forced to give girls Plan B!</p><p><em><strong>CHILL OUT!</strong></em></p><p>If a little girl was dying of thirst, would you ask her if she was a lesbian before giving her a drink?</p><p>One would hope that, in a distant future, while humanity will inevitably still bicker about silly things, we would at least know that ensuring reasonable quality of life for fellow sentient beings and trying to make our world (or solar system, at that point) a better place trumps silly arguments like why people are still using C++, or whose god has a bigger dick.</p><p>I'm not very optimistic.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-02-27T14:31:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/chill-out/>February 27, 2012 at 2:31pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/chill-out/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fchill-out%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Chill%20Out&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fchill-out%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fchill-out%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><div class=pager><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/17>Newer</a></li><li style=text-align:center><a href=/blog/>Home</a></li><li style=text-align:right><a href=/blog/page/19>Older</a></li></ul></div></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</a></li><li><a href=/blog/age-of-bullshit/>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</a></li><li><a href=/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
