This finally got Mint 12 to show up, and I later confirmed that the nvidia drivers were broken. I then discovered that the nvidia drivers in the distribution for apt-get sources are almost <strong>120 versions</strong> behind the current release (295), but the installer for that kept failing despite my attempts to fix it and having to add source repositories to apt-get because apparently these are disabled by default, which confused me greatly for a short period whilst trying to install the Linux source. This ultimately proved futile since Nvidia can't be bothered to make anything remotely easy for Linux, so I'm stuck with a half-broken default driver that can't use my second monitor with a mouse cursor that repeatedly blinks out of existence in a very aggravating manner.</p><p>Of course, the only reason I even have Linux installed is to compile things on Linux and make sure they work, so as long as my development IDE works, I should be fine! Naturally, it doesn't. Kdevelop4 is the least insultingly bad coding IDE available for Linux that isn't VIM or Emacs, which both follow in the tradition of being so amazingly configurable you'll spent half your development cycle trying to get them to work work and then learning all the arcane commands they use in order to have some semblance of productivity. Like most bizarre, functionality-oriented Linux tools, after about 6 months of torturing yourself with them, you'll probably be significantly more productive than someone on Visual Studio. Sadly, the majority of my time is not spent coding, it's spent sitting in front of a computer screen for hours trying to figure out how to get 50 lines of code to work properly. Saying that your text editor lets you be super productive assumes you are typing something all the time, and if you are doing that you are a codemonkey, not a programmer. Hence, I really don't give a fuck about how efficient a given text editor is so long as it has a couple commands I find useful in it. What's more important is that it works. KDevelop4 looked like it might actually do this, but sadly it can't find any include files. It also can't compile anything that isn't C++ because it builds everything with CMake and refuses to properly compile a C file. It has a bunch of hilariously bad user interface design choices, and basically just sucks.</p><p>So now i'm back to the command line, editing my code in Kate, the default text editor for Mint 12, forced to compile my code with GCC from the terminal. This, of course, only works when I have a single source file. Now I need to learn how to write makefiles, which are notoriously confusing and ugly and require me to do all sorts of weird things and hope GCC's -M option actually generates the right rule because the compiler itself is too stupid to figure out dependencies, but I have no IDE to tell it what to do. Then I have to link everything, and then I have to debug my program from the terminal using command line gdb, which is one of the most incredibly painful experiences I have ever had. Meanwhile, every single user experience in Linux is still terribly designed, optimized for everything except what I want to do, difficult to configure because they let you configure too much stuff and are eager to tell you in 15000 lines of manual pages about every single esoteric command no one will ever use that makes it almost impossible to find anything until you find the exact sequence of letters that will actually let you find the command your looking for and not another one that looks almost like it but does something completely different. That, of course, is if you have a web browser. I don't know what the fuck you'd even do with man. I assume you'd have to just pipe the thing into grep just to find anything.</p><p>This is not elegant. It's a bit sad, but mostly it's just painful. I hate Linux. I don't hate the kernal. I don't hate all the functionality. It's just that the people who use Linux do not think about user experience. They think in terms of translating command line functions into GUIs and trying desperately to hang on to whatever pretty graphics are cool and when something doesn't work they tell you to stop using proprietary drivers from Nvidia, except the non-proprietary drivers <em>can't actually do 3D yet</em> but that's ok, no one needs that stuff. Never mind that Linux mint 12 doesn't actually come with any diagnostic or repair tools whatsoever. Never mind that every single distro I've tried so far has been absolutely terrible one way or another. The more I am forced to use Linux, the more I crave for Windows and the fact that things tend to just <em>work</em> in Windows. Things don't work very well in Windows, but at this point that seems better than Linux's apparent preference of &ldquo;either it works really well or it doesn't work at all&rdquo;.</p><p>We could try to point fingers, but that usually doesn't solve anything. It's part nvidia's fault, it's part software vendors fault, its partly using a 40 year old window rendering engine that's so out of touch with reality it is truly painful, and it's partly the users either being too dumb to care about the broken things or too smart to use the broken things. It's a lot of people's fault. It's a lot of crap. I don't know how to fix it. I do know that it is crap, and it is broken, and it makes me want to punch the next person who says Linux is better than everything in the face, repeatedly, until he is a bloody mess on the ground begging for death to relieve his pain, because there are no words for expressing how much I hate this, and if you think I'm not being fair, good for you, I don't give a fuck. But then I can never reason with people who are incapable of listening to alternative ideas, so its usually useless to bring the topic up anyway. I suggest hundreds of tweaks to things that need to do [x] or do [x] and people are like NO THAT ISN'T NECESSARY GO AWAY YOU KNOW NOTHING. Fine. Fuck you. I'm done with this shit.</p><p>Oh wait, I still have to do my Linux homework.</p><p>EDIT: Upon further inspection, Linux Mint 12 is melting my graphics card. The graphics card fan is on, all the time, and if I run mint for too long either installed or livecd or really anything, the fan will be on the whole time and upon restart the POST check locks up. However after turning off the computer for 10 minutes and going into windows, the temperature is at 46°C, which is far below dangerous levels, so either it has a very good heatsink or the card isn't actually melting, it's just being run improperly, which doesn't really make me feel any better. Either way, I am now in an even more serious situation, because I have homework to do but Linux Mint is literally <em>breaking my computer</em>. I'd try to fix it by switching graphics drivers but at this point <em>every single driver available is broken</em>. <strong>ALL OF THEM.</strong> I don't even know what to do anymore.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-02-19T10:32:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/linux-mint-12-kde/>February 19, 2012 at 10:32am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/linux-mint-12-kde/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;6 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2flinux-mint-12-kde%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Linux%20Mint%2012%20KDE&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2flinux-mint-12-kde%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2flinux-mint-12-kde%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/new-post/>'Programmer' is an Overgeneralization</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Earlier today, I came across a post during a <em>google-fu</em> session that claimed that no one should use the C++ standard library function <code>make_heap</code>, because almost nobody uses it correctly. I immediately started mentally ranting about how utterly ridiculous this claim is, because anyone whose gone to a basic algorithm class would know how to properly use <code>make_heap</code>. Then I started thinking about all the programmers who <em>don't</em> know what a heap is, and furthermore probably don't even need to know.</p><p>Then I realized that both of these groups are still called programmers.</p><p>When I was a wee little lad, I was given a lot of very bad advice on proper programming techniques. Over the years, I have observed that most of the advice wasn't actually bad advice in-of-itself, but rather it was being given without context. The current startup wave has had an interesting effect of causing a lot of hackers to realize that &ldquo;performance doesn't matter&rdquo; is a piece of advice <em>riddled</em> with caveats and subtle context, especially when dealing with complex architectures that can interact in unexpected ways. While this <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers>broken telephone effect</a> arising from the lack of context is a widespread problem on its own, in reality it is simply a symptom of an even deeper problem.</p><p>The word programmer covers a stupendously large spectrum of abilities and skill levels. On a vertical axis, a programmer could barely know how to use vbscript, or they could be writing compilers for Intel and developing scientific computation software for aviation companies. On a horizontal axis, they could be experts on databases, or weeding performance out of a GPU, or building concurrent processing libraries, or making physics engines, or doing image processing, or generating 3D models, or writing printer drivers, or using coffeescript, HTML5 and AJAX to build web apps, or using nginx and PHP for writing the LAMP stack the web app is sitting on, or maybe they write networking libraries or do artificial intelligence research. They are all programmers.</p><p><strong>This is insane.</strong></p><p>Our world is <a href=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html>being eaten by software</a>. In the future, programming will be a basic course alongside reading and math. You'll have four R's - Reading, &lsquo;Riting, &lsquo;Rithematic, and Recursion. Saying that one is a programmer will become meaningless because 10% or more of the population will be a programmer on some level. Already the word &ldquo;programmer&rdquo; has so many possible meanings it's like calling yourself a &ldquo;scientist&rdquo; instead of a physicist. Yet, what other choices do we have? The only current attempt at fixing this gave a paltry <a href=http://www.skorks.com/2010/03/the-difference-between-a-developer-a-programmer-and-a-computer-scientist/>3 options</a> that are just incapable of conveying the differences between me and someone who graduated from college with a PhD in artificial intelligence. They do multidimensional mathematical analysis and evaluation using functional languages I will never understand without years of research. I'm supposed to write incredibly fast, clever C++ and HLSL assembly while juggling complex transformation matrices to draw pretty pictures on the screen. These jobs are both extremely difficult for completely different reasons, and neither person can do the other persons job. What is good practice for one is an abhorration for the other. We are both programmers. Even <em>within our own field</em>, we are simply graphics programmers or AI programmers or <code>[x]</code> programmers.</p><p>Do you know why we have pointless language wars, and meaningless arguments about what is good in practice? Do you know why nobody ever comes to a consensus on these views except in certain circles where &ldquo;practice&rdquo; means the same thing to everyone? Because we are overgeneralizing <em>ourselves</em>. We view ourselves as a bunch of programmers who happen to specialize in certain things, and we are making the mistake of thinking that our viewpoint applies outside of our area of expertise. We are industrial engineers trying to tell chemists how to run their experiments. We are architects trying to tell English majors how to design an essay because we both use lots of paper.</p><p>This attitude is deeply ingrained in the core of computer science. The entire point of computer science is that a bunch of basic data structures can do everything you will ever need to do. It is a fallacy to try and extend this to programming in general, because it simply is not true. We are forgetting that these data structures only do everything we need to do in the magical perfect land of mathematics, and ignore all the different implementations that are built for different areas of programming, for completely different uses. Donald Knuth understood the difference between theory and implementation - we should strive to recognize the difference between <em>theoretical</em> and <em>implementation-specific</em> advice.</p><p>It is no longer enough to simply ask someone if they are a programmer. Saying a programmer writes programs is like saying a scientist does science. The difference is that botanists don't design nuclear reactors.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2012-02-05T20:59:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/new-post/>February 5, 2012 at 8:59pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/new-post/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;33 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fnew-post%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%27Programmer%27%20is%20an%20Overgeneralization&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fnew-post%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fnew-post%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/wikipedias-identity-crisis/>Wikipedia's Identity Crisis</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>I assume we've all heard the term &ldquo;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletionism>deletionism</a>", but for the uninitiated, it simply describes a point of view that Wikipedia should only consist of high quality articles that would be relevant to an encyclopedia. This is in stark contrast to inclusionism, which contends that anything remotely useful should be retained. These two factions have been at war for quite some time, flaring up when any particularly contentious deletion debate arises. The funny thing is that <strong>both sides are right</strong>. The catch is that they are not fighting over what should be included in Wikipedia, they are fighting over what Wikipedia <em>is</em>.</p><p>The problem here is a classic case of intended usage not matching up with real usage. The crux of the issue is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Introduction>introduction to Wikipedia</a>, which states &ldquo;Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia&rdquo;. Consequently, taking everything about Wikipedia literally, the <em>deletionists</em> are in fact, correct. They delete articles that do not belong in an Encyclopedia, of which the ones in question quite often would not. Sometimes they get a little overzealous, but for the most part, they're just trying to ensure Wikipedia stays an encyclopedia.</p><p>This is a problem, because Wikipedia isn't <em>used</em> as an encyclopedia. As a culture, we treat Wikipedia as nothing less than a compendium of all human knowledge. We assume you can find anything on Wikipedia, and so long as we stay within the guidelines of an Encyclopedia, we're usually ok. Unfortunately, an encyclopedia is not a repository for the sum of all human knowledge, and thus sometimes fails to provide information that doesn't belong in an Encyclopedia, but would still be useful. Take a look at <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia>Wikipedia's definition</a> of an Encyclopedia:</p><p>It's a <strong>summary of information</strong> from <strong>branches of knowledge</strong>. This is where we start having problems. A person who is not particularly notable is still information, but not a significant part of any branch of knowledge and therefore doesn't belong in any extended summary of that information. However, that information could undoubtedly be useful to at least a few people, which is where the inclusionists are coming from. A compendium of all human knowledge is, well, <em>all</em> human knowledge. The problem is that there is <strong>a lot of it</strong>. Wikipedia has millions of articles even after being substantially trimmed down. It is clearly designed from the ground up to be an encyclopedia, not a collection of all human knowledge. In contrast, people tend to use Wikipedia as a place to store ALL information they deem even remotely relevant.</p><p>What can be done about this? Wikipedia is already suffering from growing pains as it tries to deal with millions of articles. A compendium of all human knowledge would probably have to deal with <em>hundreds of millions of articles</em>. How do you deal with that kind of information overload? Should you rework Wikipedia itself, or introduce something completely new? Do you suck all the Wikipedia articles out of its archives and &ldquo;fork&rdquo; the project? Do you start fresh and decide to require people to register before editing articles? Is a giant compendium of all human knowledge even <em>useful?</em> These are the questions we are going to have to answer as the amount of information continues to explode at an exponential rate.

The consensus should be that any one programmer is going to use whatever language they are most comfortable with that gets the job done most efficiently. If someone knows C/C++, C#, and Java, they're probably going to use C++ to write a console game. You can argue that language <em>[x]</em> is terrible because of <em>[x]</em>, but the problem is that <em>ALL</em> languages are terrible for one reason or another. Every aspect of a languages design is a series of trade-offs, and if you try to criticize a language that is useful in one context because it isn't useful in another, you are ignoring the entire concept of a trade-off.</p><p>These arguments go on for hours upon hours, about what exactly is a trade-off and what languages arguably have stupid features and what makes someone a good programer and <em>blah blah blah blah <strong>SHUT UP</strong></em>. I don't care what language you used, if your program is shit, <em>your program is shit</em>. I don't care if you wrote it in Clojure or used MongoDB or used continuations and closures in whatever esoteric functional language happens to be popular right now. Your program <em>still sucks</em>. If someone else writes a better program in C without any elegant use of anything, and it works better than your program, <em>they're doing their job better than you</em>.</p><p>I don't care if they aren't as good a programmer as you are, by whatever stupid, arbitrary standards you've invented to make yourself feel better, they're <em>still doing a better job than you</em>. I don't care if your haskell editor was written in haskell. Good for you. <em><strong>It sucks</strong></em>. It is terribly designed. It's workflow is about as conducive as a blob of molasses on a mountain in January. I don't care if you are using a fantastic stack of professionally designed standard libraries instead of re-inventing the wheel. That guy over there re-invented the wheel the wrong way 10 times and <em>his program is better than yours</em> because it's designed with the <em>user</em> in mind instead of a bunch of stupid libraries. I don't care if you're using Mercurial over SVN or Git on Linux using Emacs with a bunch of extensions that make you super productive. <em>Your program still sucks</em>.</p><p>I am sick and tired of people judging programmers on a bunch of rules that don't matter. Do you know functional programming? Do you know how to implement a LAMP stack? Obviously you don't use C++ or anything like that, do you?</p><p>These programmers have <em>no goddamn idea what they're talking about</em>. But that isn't what concerns me. What concerns me is that programmers are so obsessed over what language is best or what tool is best or what library they should use when they should be more concerned about what their program actually <em>DOES</em>. They get so caught up in building whatever elegant crap they're trying to build they completely forget what the end user experience is, especially when the end user has never used the program before. Just as you are not a slave to your tools, your program is not enslaved to your libraries.</p><p>Your program's design should serve the user, not a bunch of data structures.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-12-24T17:55:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/your-esoteric-language-is-useless/>December 24, 2011 at 5:55pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/your-esoteric-language-is-useless/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;5 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fyour-esoteric-language-is-useless%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Your%20Esoteric%20Language%20is%20Useless&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fyour-esoteric-language-is-useless%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fyour-esoteric-language-is-useless%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/great-mystery-of-linear-gradient/>The Great Mystery of Linear Gradient Lighting</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>A long, long time ago, in pretty much the same place I'm sitting in right now, I was learning how one would do 2D lighting with soft shadows and discovered the age old adage in 2D graphics: linear gradient lighting looks better than mathematically correct inverse square lighting.</p><p>Strange.</p><p>I brushed it off as artistic license and perceptual trickery, but over the years, as I dug into advanced lighting concepts, nothing could explain this. It was a mystery. Around the time I discovered microfacet theory I figured it could theoretically be an attempt to approximate non-lambertanian reflectance models, but even that wouldn't turn an exponential curve into a linear one.</p><p>This bizarre law even showed up in my 3D lighting experiments. Attempting to invoke the inverse square law would simply result in extremely bright and dark areas and would look absolutely terrible, and yet the only apparent fix I saw anywhere was simply calculating light via linear distance in clear violation of observed light behavior. Everywhere I looked, people calculated light on a linear basis, everywhere, on everything. Was it the equations? Perhaps the equations being used operated on linear light values instead of exponential ones and so only output the correct value if the light was linear? No, that wasn't it. I couldn't figure it out. Years and years and years would pass with this discrepancy left unaccounted for.</p><p>A few months ago I noted an article on gamma correction and assumed it was related to color correction or some other post process effect designed to compensate for monitor behavior, and put it as a very low priority research point on my mental to-do-list. No reason fixing up minor brightness problems until your graphics engine can actually render everything properly. Yesterday, though, I happened across a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3294840">Hacker News</a> posting about learning modern 3D engine programming. Curious if it had anything I didn't already know, I ran through its topics, and <a href=http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/Texturing/Tutorial%2016.html>found this</a>. Gamma correction wasn't just making the scene brighter to fit with the monitor, it was compensating for the fact that <em>most images are actually already gamma-corrected</em>.</p><p>In a nutshell, the brightness of a monitor is exponential, not linear (with a power of about 2.2). The result is that a linear gradient displayed on the monitor is not actually increasing in brightness linearly. Because it's mapped to a curve, it will actually increase in brightness exponentially. This is due to the human visual system processing luminosity on a logarithmic scale. The curve in question is this:</p><p><a href=http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/elementLinks/24fig02.jpg target=_blank><img src=http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/elementLinks/24fig02.jpg alt="Gamma Response Curve"></a>

Sure it looks a little dark, but hey, I suppose that might happen if you're increasing at 25% increments, right? <strong>WRONG</strong>. The <em>bottom strip</em> is a true linear gradient<sup>1</sup>. The top strip is a literal assignment of linear gradient RGB values, going from 0 to 62 to 126, etc. While this is, digitally speaking, a mathematical linear gradient, what happens when it gets displayed on the screen? It gets distorted by the CRT Gamma curve seen in the above graph, which makes the end value <em>exponential</em>. The bottom strip, on the other hand, is gamma corrected - it is NOT a mathematical linear gradient. It's values go from 0 to <strong>134</strong> to <strong>185</strong>. As a result, when this exponential curve is displayed on your monitor, it's values are dragged down by the exact inverse exponential curve, resulting in a true linear curve. An image that has been &ldquo;gamma-corrected&rdquo; in this manner is said to exist in sRGB color space.</p><p>The thing is, most images <em>aren't linear</em>. They're actually in the sRGB color space, otherwise they'd look totally wrong when we viewed them on our monitors. Normally, this doesn't matter, which is why most 2D games simply ignore gamma completely. Because all a 2D engine does is take a pixel and display it on the screen without touching it, if you enable gamma correction you will actually <em>over-correct</em> the image and it will look terrible. This becomes a problem with image editing, because digital artists are drawing and coloring things on their monitors and they try to make sure that everything looks good <em>on their monitor</em>. So if an artist were visually trying to make a linear gradient, they would probably make something similar to the already gamma-corrected strip we saw earlier. Because virtually no image editors linearize images when saving (for good reason), the resulting image an artist creates is <em>actually in sRGB color space</em>, which is why only turning on gamma correction will usually simply make everything look bright and washed out, since you are normally using images that are <em>already gamma-corrected</em>. This is actually good thing due to subtle precision issues, but it creates a serious problem when you start trying to do lighting calculations.</p><p>The thing is, lighting calculations are linear operations. It's why you use Linear Algebra for most of your image processing needs. Because of this, when I tried to use the inverse-square law for my lighting functions, the resulting value that I was multiplying on to the already-gamma-corrected image <em><strong>was not gamma corrected!</strong></em> In order to do proper lighting, you would have to first linearize the gamma-corrected image, perform the lighting calculation on it, and then re-gamma-correct the end result.</p><p>Wait a minute, what did we say the gamma curve value was? It's <span class=math>$$ x^{2.2} $$</span>, so <span class=math>$$ x^{0.45} $$</span> will gamma-correct the value <span class=math>$$ x $$</span>. But the inverse square law states that the intensity of a light is actually <span class=math>$$ \frac{1}{x^2} $$</span>, so if you were to gamma correct the inverse square law, you'd end up with:<div class=math>\[ {\bigg(\frac{1}{x^2}}\bigg)^{0.45} = {x^{-2}}^{0.45} = x^{-0.9} ≈ x^{1} \]</div><em>That's almost linear!<sup>2</sup></em></p><p><strong><span style=font-size:200%>OH MY GOD<br></span></strong><a href=http://bucultureshock.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mind-blown-11.jpeg target=_blank><img src=http://bucultureshock.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mind-blown-11.jpeg alt="MIND == BLOWN"></a></p><p><em><strong>That's it!</strong></em> The reason I saw linear curves all over the place was because it was a rough approximation to gamma correction! The reason linear lighting looks good in a 2D game is because its actually an approximation to a <em>gamma-corrected inverse-square law!</em> <strong>Holy shit!</strong> Why didn't anyone ever explain this?!<sup>3</sup> Now it all makes sense! Just to confirm my findings, I went back to my 3D lighting experiment, and sure enough, after correcting the gamma values, using the inverse square law for the lighting gave correct results! <strong>MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</strong></p><p>For those of you using OpenGL, you can implement gamma correction as explained in the article <a href=http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/Texturing/Tutorial%2016.html>mentioned above</a>. For those of you using DirectX9 (not 10), you can simply enable <code>D3DSAMP_SRGBTEXTURE</code> on whichever texture stages are using sRGB textures (usually only the diffuse map), and then enable <code>D3DRS_SRGBWRITEENABLE</code> during your drawing calls (a gamma-correction stateblock containing both of those works nicely). For things like GUI, you'll probably want to bypass the sRGB part. Like OpenGL, you can also skip <code>D3DRS_SRGBWRITEENABLE</code> and simply gamma-correct the entire blended scene using <code>D3DCAPS3_LINEAR_TO_SRGB_PRESENTATION</code> in the <code>Present()</code> call, but this has a lot of caveats attached. In DirectX10, you no longer use <code>D3DSAMP_SRGBTEXTURE</code>. Instead, you use an sRGB texture format (see <a href=http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/5/5/b55d67ff-f1cb-4174-836a-bbf8f84fb7e1/Picture%20Perfect%20-%20Gamma%20Through%20the%20Rendering%20Pipeline.zip>this presentation</a> for details).</p><span style=font-size:80%><br><sup>1</sup> or at least much closer, depending on your monitors true gamma response<br><sup>2</sup> In reality I'm sweeping a whole bunch of math under the table here.
