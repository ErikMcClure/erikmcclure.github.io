Many people realize that inverting a binary tree on a whiteboard has basically zero correlation to whether or not someone is actually a good software developer. The most effective programming test anyone's come up with is still <a href=https://www.globalnerdy.com/2012/11/15/fizzbuzz-still-works/>Fizzbuzz</a>. One consequence of this has been an increased emphasis on Open Source Contributions, but it turns out <a href=https://blog.ploeh.dk/2021/03/22/the-dispassionate-developer/>these aren't a very good metric either</a>, because most people don't have that kind of time.</p><p>The most effective programming interview we have now is usually some kind of take-home project, where a candidate is asked to fix a bug or implement a small feature within a few days. This isn't great because it takes up a lot of time, and they could recieve outside help (or, if the feature is sufficiently common, google it). On the other hand, some large companies have instead doubled-down on whiteboard style interviews by subjecting prospective engineers to multiple hour-long online coding assessments, with varying levels of invasive surveillience.</p><p>All these interviewing methods pale in comparison to a very simple metric: <strong>playing Factorio with someone</strong>. Going through an entire run of Factorio is almost the best possible indication of how well someone deals with common technical problems. You can even tweak the playthrough based on the seniority of the position you're hiring for to get a better sense of how they'll function in that role.</p><h3 id=factorio>Factorio?</h3><p>Factorio is a game about automation. The best introduction is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVvXv1Z6EY8">this trailer</a>, but in essence, your job is to build an automated factory capable of launching a rocket into space.</p><p>You begin with nothing. You mine stone manually to craft a smelter that can smelt iron ore you mined into iron plates, which you then use to build a coal-driven automatic miner. You could grab the iron ore from the miner and put it in the smelter yourself, but it's more efficient to use an inserter to do the inserting for you. Then you can use the iron this gives you to make another miner, which automates coal mining. Then you can use belts to take the coal and use an inserter to put it in the iron miner. Then you use the iron plates this tiny factory produces to make a third miner to start gathering copper, which then lets you craft copper wire, which lets you craft a circuit, which lets you build a water pump. Combined with a boiler and a steam engine, you can then build produce power, and use this power to run a research facility to unlock new technology, like assembly machines. Once you've unlocked assembly machines, you can use your circuits to craft an assembly machine that can craft copper wire for you, and insert this into an assembly machine that crafts circuits for you.</p><p>Eventually you unlock trains and robots and logistic systems which help you deal with the increasing logistic complexity the game demands, until you finally manage to launch a rocket into space.</p><h3 id=self-direction>Self-Direction</h3><p>The beginning of the game starts with no goals and barely any direction. A senior developer should be able to explore the UI and figure out a goal, then establish a plan for accomplishing that goal. A junior developer should be able to perform a task that a senior developer has provided for them. An intern is expected to require quite a bit of mentoring, but a junior developer should be able to troubleshoot basic problems with their own code before requiring assistance from the senior developer. An intermediate developer should be able to operate independently once given a task, but is not expected to do any architecture design.</p><p>In more concrete terms, you might expect the following:</p><ul><li>An <strong>Intern</strong> is generally expected to be able to fill in a pre-placed blueprint, and use belts to hook up their blueprint with something else, like an ore patch.</li><li>A <strong>Junior Developer</strong> should be able to build a production line by themselves, although it probably won't be very optimal. They may need assistance from the senior developer on how to route the belts properly to all of the intermediate assembly machines.</li><li>An <strong>Intermediate Developer</strong> should be capable of designing a near-optimal production line (without beacons) once given direction, with minimal oversight.</li><li>The <strong>Senior Developer</strong> needs no direction, and is capable of determining what goals need to happen and designing a plan of action, then delegating these tasks to other coders.</li></ul><h3 id=teamwork>Teamwork</h3><p>A critical aspect of software development is the ability to work on a team. This means coordinating your efforts with other people, accomadating the needs of other people's designs and cooperating with the team, instead of simply running off on your own and refusing to adjust your design to help integrate it with someone else's work. This, naturally, arises all the time in Factorio, because base layout designs are limited by physical space. As a result, you need to carefully consider what other people are doing, and sometimes adjust your design to fit in size constraints or deal with someone else's design that took more room than anticipated.</p><p>Anyone who simply runs off and starts doing things themselves or fixing problems without telling people is going to quickly earn the ire of their fellow players, for the exact same reasons cowboy programmers do. Luckily, Factorio includes a built-in equivelent to <code>git blame</code>, by showing you the last player that modified any entity. Thus, when people duct tape temporary solutions and don't inform the team about the problem they were fixing, when their temporary solution finally blows up, people will find out. If people want to win they game, they'll have to learn to cooperate well with their teammates.</p><h3 id=debugging>Debugging</h3><p>One of the most important skills for any programmer is their ability to debug problems. This is perhaps the most obvious parallel between Factorio and real software engineering. Something can go wrong very far away from the actual source of the problem. Being able to rapidly hone in on the real problem is a critical skill, and the thinking process is almost identical to tracing the cause of a crash in an actual program. If an assembly machine has stopped working, first you have to see if there are multiple outputs that got backed up. Then you have to check what ingredient it's missing. Then you have to trace the ingredient back through your factory to find out where you're making it, and repeat ad nauseum.</p><p>Factorio's debugging gets fairly complicated quite quickly. As soon as you start working on oil processing you'll be dealing with cracking, where you're dealing with 3 different outputs and if any of them get backed up for any reason, the entire thing stops. There are cases where your entire factory can grind to a halt because you started researching something that doesn't require yellow science, which stopped using up robot frames, which stopped using up electric engines, which stopped using lubricant, which stopped consuming heavy oil, which backed up and stopped oil production, which made you run out of petroleum, which broke plastic, which broke red circuits, which broke the rest of the factory. Seasoned players will anticipate scenarios like this and use circuits to construct self-balancing oil cracking to ensure the system is balanced and will only back up if petroleum backs up. A new player who is a good programmer, when presented with a factory that has collapsed, will usually be able to trace the issue back to the source, realize what's happened, and promptly attempt to figure out a solution. On the other hand, if someone simply plops down a few storage tanks, unless they can provide a good reason (they are very confident we will never stop consuming lubricant in the future), then this is a red flag for how they approach problem solving in their programs.</p><p>Situations like these allow Factorio to closely mimic the complex interdependencies that programmers routinely deal with, and the complexity simply increases the more gameplay concepts are added. This closely follows the increased complexity that additional layers of abstraction introduce when attempting to debug a crash that could have potentially occured deep inside one of the frameworks you use.</p><h3 id=code-reviews>Code Reviews</h3><p>Often, initial designs need to be tweaked for performance or throughput. Good programmers will not only accept critique of their designs, but incorporate that feedback into their future work. If they disagree with a proposed change, they will provide a concrete reason for why they disagree so that the team can more accurately weigh the pros and cons of the proposed change.</p><p>Resisting feedback without providing good reasons is a well-known red flag, but what can also be problematic is a programmer who begrudgingly accepts proposed changes, but refuses to adjust future designs accordingly. They end up requiring constant reminders to adhere to some standard way of solving a problem while giving no reason for why they don't seem to like the way the team is doing things. These can be ticking time-bombs in organizations, because when left unsupervised they can rapidly accumulate technical debt for other team members. This kind of problem is almost impossible to catch in a traditional interview, unless it's an internship.</p><h3 id=code-style-and-frameworks>Code Style and Frameworks</h3><p>Refusing to incorporate feedback is often just a slice of a much larger problem, where someone is unable to integrate properly into an existing framework being used. There are many ways to build a factory in Factorio, and each one requires standard methods of building pieces. Failing to adhere to standards can very quickly jam up an entire factory, often in subtle ways that aren't necessarily obvious to a careless developer.</p><p>In the Main Belt design, a set of 4-8 chunk of belts, divided by 2 spaces to allow for underground belts, are placed in the center of the factory, and all production happens perpendicular to the belt. This design relies on several rules that can wreck havoc if not followed correctly. One, players must always use a splitter to pull items off of a belt, never redirecting the entire belt, otherwise using the empty space for a different belt of items means you'll have permanently lost one entire belt of resources, even after upgrading belts. Two, all factories must be scalable in a direction perpendicular to the main belt. Failing to do this will rapidly result in either a massive waste of space, or a production line that cannot be scaled up because it's surrounded by other production lines.</p><p>There are also different ways of building logistic networks. The simplest method is with passive provider chests, but another method uses a storage chest with a filter, which is used to solve the trashed item problem. Both of these methods require properly setting limiters in the right location. Passive provider chests generally are limited by chest space. Storage chests require hooking the inserter for the chest up to the logistics network and ensuring that less than N of an item exists before inserting it. Forgetting to perform these limiting steps is a massive waste of resources. <em>Consistently</em> forgetting to put limiters on outputs is a red flag for someone who is careless about performance in real-world applications.</p><p>In other cases, the team may be using some pre-designed blueprints, like a nuclear reactor design, or a bot factory. These can be extremely complex, but as long as people are willing to learn how to use them, they can be huge time-savers. Beware of candidates who don't want to learn how to set up a new item in the bot factory simply because they can't debug the complex logic that drives it, or ones that get frustrated learning how to use a bot factory despite the clear and obvious benefits.</p><h3 id=multithreading>Multithreading</h3><p>Trains in Factorio are a direct analogue to multithreading: one train is one thread of execution, and each train intersection or train stop is a place in memory where two threads could potentially write at the same time. Train signals are locks, or mutexes. All bugs in train networks manifest in exactly the same way software race conditions do, because they're literally physical race conditions. All of the tradeoffs apply here as well - if you make a lock too large, it slows down your throughput, because now the intersection is blocked for a longer period of time. Incorrectly signaled tracks routinely cause train deadlocks that are exactly the same as a software deadlock, because you end up with a circular lock dependency. The most common deadlock is when a train is too long and unexpectedly blocks a second intersection while waiting to enter one. This second intersection then prevents another train from leaving, preventing the first intersection from ever being unblocked.</p><p>The number of lanes of track in your network is equivilent to the number of cores available in your CPU. A single rail line is difficult to scale beyond a few threads because the entire system gets throughput limited very quickly, even with wait areas. The most common design is a two-lane design where each lane is a single direction, but this will eventually suffer from throughput issues when you need trains constantly being unloaded. Thus, large bases tend to have at least 4 lanes, with two outer lanes acting as bypasses to avoid the intersection whenever possible.</p><p>Missing signal problems in these systems can take a ridiculous amount of time to actually show up. A single missing signal in one rail network once caused a deadlock after functioning correctly for <em>two weeks</em>. This is remniscient of difficult to pin down race conditions in software that only occur once a month or so when under high contention.</p><h3 id=scaling>Scaling</h3><p>Just like in software, scaling up production in Factorio introduces new problems with initial designs, and often require complete redesigns that can pipe resources into factories as fast as possible, while taking advange of production modules and speed module beacons. Belt limits become problematic even at the fastest belt speed, forcing players to find ways to split designs up so that more belts can be put in later down the line, or split up their factories into modules.</p><p>Handling your logistics network itself becomes a logistics problem in the late game because of how problematic expansive bot networks are. You generally need to start segmenting the logistics network and either using trains to transport items between them, or build a requester chest/provider chest that propagates items across bounderies.</p><p>Managing trains in the late game necessitates switching to a pull architecture from a push architecture, because the push architecture can't function in high throughput. This inevitably requires taking advantage of the Train Limits feature and learning how circuit networks can be used to encode basic logic, such that a station only requests a train when it is actually ready to completely fill the train with resources, instead of the common early game tactic of simply telling a bunch of trains to go to stations named &ldquo;Iron Pickup&rdquo;. This minimizes the number of trains you need while making sure all stops are served on the network.</p><p>Often times, limitations in the number of possible inputs to an assembly machine and inserter speed require redesigning factories around them, just like how high-speed computing requires being aware of subtle bottlenecks in how your CPU works. These bottlenecks are almost never a problem until you reach a certain scale, at which point they begin to dominate your efficiency.</p><h3 id=microservices-and-plugin-architectures>Microservices and Plugin Architectures</h3><p>Eventually, factories get so enormous they must abandon a simple main belt or spaghetti design and use a more scalable framework instead. To reach Megabase-scale, factories generally either use a train system or a module system, which corresponds roughly to microservices or a plugin-architecture.</p><p>A train-based megabase is sometimes referred to a &ldquo;city-block&rdquo; design, where trains surrounded factory blocks and control all input and output. Thus, each individual city-block is isolated from all other city-blocks, since all their input is &ldquo;pure&rdquo; in that it comes from the train network. This is almost identical to a micro-services architecture (over HTTP) or a multi-process design (using IPC), and has similar potential issues with input and output latency, because results cannot be continually provided, they must be emitted in &ldquo;packets&rdquo;, or trains along the network.</p><p>The plugin architecture seeks to maintain some semblence of a main-belt, but instead splits belts off through the factory and uses modular blocks that take standard inputs and standard outputs. Sometimes this can be achieved entirely through bots, but materials usually need to be belted over long distances. This closely resembles a plugin system for a monolithic application, and has similar tradeoffs.</p><p>These megabases mark the extreme upper end of a vanilla Factorio server. However, there are plenty of mods to make things much more complex.</p><h3 id=distributed-systems>Distributed Systems</h3><p><a href=https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration>Space Exploration</a> is an overhaul of Factorio that adds an entire space segment of the game, and makes planets have limited resources, requiring players to colonize other planets and use rockets to transfer resources between planets. Because of the enormous latency involved with shipping materials between planets, coordinating these different bases winds up having similar problems to a globally distributed database system. Even the circuit network has to contend with latency, because an automatic request system loses track of items that have been launched but haven't yet reached the target planet. Not accounting for this will result in a <em>double-request</em> for all the items you wanted, which is the <em>exact same problem</em> that distributed systems have when trying to ensure consistency.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>Collectively, the software industry simply has no idea how to hire software developers. Factorio is probably the best technical interview we have right now, and <em>that's embarassing</em>. It is also wildly impractical, taking over 20 hours in an initial multiplayer playthrough, or 8 hours if you have a lot of people and know what you're doing. What's the takeaway from this? I don't know. We certainly can't switch to using Factorio as an interviewing method - you might as well just give a candidate a take-home assignment.</p><p>At the very least, we can do better than whiteboard interviews.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2021-03-12T15:26:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/factorio-is-best-interview-we-have/>March 12, 2021 at 3:26pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/factorio-is-best-interview-we-have/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffactorio-is-best-interview-we-have%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Factorio%20Is%20The%20Best%20Technical%20Interview%20We%20Have&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffactorio-is-best-interview-we-have%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffactorio-is-best-interview-we-have%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffactorio-is-best-interview-we-have%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/why-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17/>Why You Can't Use Prebuilt LLVM 10.0 with C++17</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>C++17 introduced <a href=https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new>an alignment argument</a> to <code>::operator new()</code>. It's important to note that if you allocate something using aligned new, you <strong>absolutely must</strong> deallocate it <a href=https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/delete>using aligned delete</a>, or the behavior is undefined. LLVM 10.x takes advantage of this alignment parameter, if the compiler supports it. That means if you are compiling on Windows with MSVC set to C++14, <code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is not defined and the extra argument isn't passed. Otherwise, if it's compiled with MSVC set to C++17, <a href=https://en.cppreference.com/w/User:D41D8CD98F/feature_testing_macros><code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is defined</a> and the extra argument is passed.</p><p>There's just one teeny tiny little problem - <a href=https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6d2f73f821ed5ea584869924b150ac2e6e65c12e/llvm/include/llvm/Support/Compiler.h#L568>the check was in a header file</a>.</p><p>Now, if this header file were completely internal and LLVM itself only ever called <code>::operator new()</code> from inside it's libraries, this wouldn't be a problem. As you might have guessed, this was not the case. LLVM was calling <code>allocate_buffer()</code> from inside header files. The corresponding <code>deallocate_buffer</code> call <em>was</em> inside the same header file, but sadly, it was called from a destructor, and <em>that</em> destructor had been called from inside one of LLVM's libraries, which meant it didn't know about aligned allocations&mldr; <strong>Oops!</strong></p><p>This means, if your program uses C++17, but LLVM was compiled with C++14, your program will happily pass LLVM <strong>aligned memory</strong>, which LLVM will then pass into <strong>the wrong delete operator</strong>, because it's calling the unaligned delete function from C++14 instead of the aligned delete function from C++17. This results in strange and bizarre heap corruption errors because of the mismatched <code>::operator new</code> and <code>::operator delete</code>. Arguably, the real bug here is LLVM calling any allocation function from a header file in the first place, as this is just begging for ABI problems.</p><p>Of course, one might ask why a C++17 application would be linking against LLVM compiled with C++14. Well, you see, the <a href=https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-10.0.0>prebuilt LLVM binaries</a> were compiled against C++14&mldr; <strong>OOPS!</strong> Suddenly if you wanted to avoid compiling LLVM yourself, you couldn't use C++17 anymore!</p><p>Luckily <a href=https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7aaff8fd2da2812a2b3cbc8a41af29774b10a7d6><strong>this has now been fixed</strong></a> after a bunch of people complained about the extremely unintuitive errors resulting from this mismatch. Unfortunately, as of this writing, <a href=https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/>LLVM still hasn't provided a new release</a>, which means you will still encounter this problem using the latest precompiled binaries of LLVM. Personally, I recompile LLVM using C++17 for my own projects, just to be safe, since LLVM does not gaurantee ABI compatibility in these situations.</p><p>Still, this is a particularly nasty case of an unintentional ABI break between C++ versions, which is easy to miss because most people assume C++ versions are backwards compatible. Be careful, and stop allocating memory in header files that might be deallocated inside your library!</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2020-07-09T02:50:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17/>July 9, 2020 at 2:50am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/why-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why%20You%20Can%27t%20Use%20Prebuilt%20LLVM%2010.0%20with%20C%2b%2b17&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/someone-is-stealing-tracker-songs/>Someone Is Stealing Tracker Songs And Selling Them</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Today, in response to a tweet talking about old untitled song ideas, I mentioned that I had a strange file called &ldquo;t.mp3&rdquo; sitting in my downloads folder that had been there for years and have no attached metadata or hint as to where it came from. It appeared to be a complete recording of a chiptune song, and it sounded very nice, but I had no way of knowing the original source. To my surprise, someone else had heard the song and hunted down a source on youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oVc6_2jb7E">S0 C1os3 - H4X0r</a>.</p><p><strong>But something was wrong</strong>. That video was uploaded in <strong>2019</strong>. The file I had was last modified in January 2010, over <em>10 years ago</em>, and for that matter it had been sitting in my downloads folder for almost as long. Perhaps the artist simply hadn't uploaded it to YouTube until recently? I decided to scroll through the comments, and discovered that someone posted the real name of the track: &ldquo;So Close&rdquo; by Floppi. I was even able to find the <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=46170">original XM file</a>, and sure enough, it had been uploaded way back in 2003.</p><p>Now, some random person uploading an old song on youtube and trying to take credit isn't really that surprising, but this Youtube channel is special - it's a <strong>Topic</strong> channel, which is autogenerated from the Google Play Store. It even says in the description, &ldquo;Provided to YouTube by DistroKid&rdquo;. DistroKid is a music distribution service that automatically registers and uploads your album to all the major online music stores. I've used a similar service for my own albums, and do in fact have my own autogenerated Topic channel on Youtube, which is&mldr; kind of creepy, but that's besides the point.</p><p>The point is that <strong>someone has stolen 11 classic demoscene tracker songs and is selling them on every major online music store.</strong> The album is called &ldquo;H4x0r R007z&rdquo; and it consists entirely of blatantly stolen tracker songs lazily renamed using 1337 text, which usually means finding the original song is pretty easy. Because it was published via DistroKid, you can find it on <a href=https://open.spotify.com/album/5FX3bM1XqCMtWxmRl7F89K>Spotify</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/preview/Bthmoz2r45ruexekqsvvrbto3au?play=1">Google Play</a>, <a href=https://music.apple.com/us/album/h4x0r-r007z-hacker-roots/1450759001>iTunes</a>, <a href=https://www.amazon.com/H4x0r-R007z-Hacker-Roots-H4X0r/dp/B07N675DCN>Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.deezer.com/album/85630742?autoplay=true">Deezer</a>, <a href="https://www.iheart.com/artist/H4X0r-32755715/albums/H4x0r+R007z+%28Hacker+Roots%29-68519698?autoplay=true">iHeartRadio</a> and it's been registered into the automatically populated copyrighted songs databases! That means the artist &ldquo;H4x0r&rdquo; could <strong>legally issue copyright takedowns for every other legitimate upload of the actual songs</strong>, or abuse Google's automatic fingerprinting system to force monetization on all of the videos and take all the income.</p><p>The songs that were stolen were often used in keygen cracking software that was popular in the 2000s to pirate software. Many people have noted that this was often their first introduction to tracker music, and this is likely the source of the name &ldquo;H4x0r R007z&rdquo;, even though the songs themselves usually had nothing to do with the hacker groups. The original tracker files are still available in the scene archives, and other Youtube channels have uploaded MP3 recordings of the songs <em>with proper attribution</em>. I was able to source 9 out of the 11 songs from the album, with the real name and artist, plus a Youtube or Soundcloud recording (if you'd like to play the original files yourself, you can use <a href=https://www.un4seen.com/>XMPlay</a>).</p><ol><li><strong>0 Pr1m4ry</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;primary&rdquo; by Ramosa<br>Original file: <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=67555">ramosa-primary.mod</a><br>Only exists on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogTHhDhWXm8">H4x0r channel</a></li><li><strong>5murf-E5Que</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;Smurf-Esque &lsquo;98&rdquo; by AGAiN<br>Author Info: Made with FastTracker 2 by Three Little Elks (3LE): Android (Jonas Kapla) Ant (Anton Halldin), Coma (Daniel Johansson), Nude (Sten Ulfsson), Tabasco (Niklas Soerensson)<br>Original file: <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=66589">smurf-es.mod</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zc4ALM3Gww">Youtube</a></li><li><strong>Vib35 F20m Pa57</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;Vibes From Past&rdquo; by <a href=https://soundcloud.com/fegolhuzz>Fegolhuzz</a> (Figge Wasberger)<br>Original file: <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=170642">fegolhuzz_-_vibes_from_past.xm</a><br><a href=https://soundcloud.com/fegolhuzz/vibes-from-past>SoundCloud</a></li><li><strong>Bra1n Wound</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;Brain Wound&rdquo; by <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_profile&query=68760">Ghidorah</a><br>Original file: <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=39531">bw.xm</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfPtcZO2TWo">Youtube</a></li><li><strong>Hy8r1d 50n9</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;Funky Stars (Hybrid Song)&rdquo; by Quazar (Axel Christofer Hedfors)<br>Author Info: Quazar is an old alias of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axwell>Axwell</a>, one of the members of the Swedish House Mafia.<br>Original file: <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=66187">external.xm</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LiTxEUxSHU">Youtube</a></li><li><strong>D0d3ch3dr0n</strong><br>I was unable to source this song, possibly because the original song name was a mispelling of Dodecahedron</li><li><strong>51ne-15te2</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;Sine-ister&rdquo; by dreamfish<br>Original file: <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=67503">sineiste.mod</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x93cD6zvww">Youtube</a> (Some recordings seem to have more clarity than XMPlay provides, but it's not clear if this was intended)</li><li><strong>Au70ma71k</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;Automatik&rdquo; by Rez<br>Original file: <a href=https://files.scene.org/view/music/artists/rez/rez-automatik.zip>rez-automatik.mod</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9yfqCDreDc">Youtube</a></li><li><strong>S3rV1l</strong><br>I was also unable to source this song, possibly due to spelling errors.</li><li><strong>S0 C1os3</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;So Close&rdquo; by Floppi (Tero Laihanen)<br>Original file: <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=46170">intro13.xm</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7mgXC7t8PA">Youtube</a></li><li><strong>5or3 Po1nt</strong><br>Real Name: &ldquo;Sore Point&rdquo;<br>Author Information: The original author of this song is unknown, although it was converted to .xm format for Infinitode 2.

My friends and I were determined to keep our discord server public, so I went about creating the first anti-spam bot for Discord.</p><p>I am no longer maintaining this bot beyond simple bugfixes because I have better things to do with my time, and I'm tired of people trying to use it because &ldquo;it's the best anti-spam bot&rdquo; even after I deprecated it. This post is an effort to educate all the other anti-spam bots on how to ascend beyond a simple &ldquo;mute someone if they send more than N messages in M seconds&rdquo; filter and hopefully make better anti-spam bots so I don't have to.</p><h2 id=architecture>Architecture</h2><p>There are disagreements over exactly how an anti-spam bot should work, with a wide-range of preferred behaviors that differ between servers, depending on the community, size of the server, rate of growth of the server, and the administrators personal preferences. Many anti-spam solutions lock down the server by forcing new members to go through an airlock channel, but I consider this overkill and the result of poor anti-spam bots that are bad at actually stopping trolls or responding to raids.</p><p>My moderation architecture goes like this:<br><pre><code>-- Channels --  
#Moderation Channel  
#Raid Containment  
#Silence Containment  
#Log Channel

-- Roles --  
@Member  
@Silence  
@New</code></pre></p><p>When first-time setup is run on a server, the bot queries and stores all the permissions given to the <code>@everyone</code> role. It adds all these permissions to the <code>@Member</code> role, then goes through all existing users and adds the <code>@Member</code> role to them. It then <strong>removes all permissions from <code>@everyone</code></strong>, but adds an override for <code>#Raid Containment</code> so that anyone without the <code>@Member</code> role can only speak in <code>#Raid Containment</code>.</p><p>Then, it creates the <code>@Silence</code> role by adding permission overrides to every single channel on the server that prevent you from <em>sending</em> messages on that channel, except for the <code>#Silence Containment</code> channel. This ensures that, no matter what new roles might be added in the future, <code>@Silence</code> will always prevent you from sending messages on any channel other than <code>#Silence Containment</code>. The admins of the server can configure the visibility of the containment channels. Most servers make it so <code>#Raid Containment</code> is only visible to anyone without the <code>@Member</code> role, ensure <code>#Silence Containment</code> is only visible to anyone with the <code>@Silence</code> role, and hide <code>#Log Channel</code> from everyone except admins.</p><p>This architecture was chosen to allow the bot to survive a mega-raid, so that even if 500+ bot accounts storm the server all at once, if the bot goes down or is rate-limited, they can't do anything because they haven't been given the <code>@Member</code> role, and so the server is protected by default. This is essentially an automated airlock that only engages if the bot detects a raid, instead of forcing all new members to go through the airlock. Some admins do not like this approach because they prefer to personally audit every new member, but this is not viable for larger servers.</p><p>The <code>@Member</code> role being added can also short-circuit Discord's own verification rules, which is an unfortunate consequence, but in practice it usually isn't a problem. However, to help compensate for this, the bot can also be configured to add a temporary <code>@New</code> role to newer users that expires after a configurable amount of time. What this role actually does is up to the administrators - usually it simply disables sharing images or embeds.</p><h2 id=operation>Operation</h2><p>The bot has two distinct modes of operation. Under normal operation, when a new member joins the server, they are automatically given <code>@Member</code> (and <code>@New</code> if it's been enabled) and are immediately allowed to speak. If they trigger the anti-spam, or a moderator uses the <code>!silence</code> command, they will have the <code>@Silence</code> role added, any messages sent in the last 5 seconds (by default) will be deleted, and they'll be restricted to speaking in <code>#Silence Containment</code>. By default, silences that happen automatically are never rescinded until a moderator manually unsilences someone. However, some server admins are lazy, so an automatic expiration can be added. A manual silence can also be configured to expire after a set period of time. If a user triggers the anti-spam filter again <em>while they are in the containment channel</em>, then the bot will automatically ban them.</p><p>It's important to note that when silenced, users have <strong>both</strong> the <code>@Member</code> and the <code>@Silence</code> role. The reason is because many servers have opt-in channels that are only accessible if you add a role to yourself. Simply removing <code>@Member</code> would not suffice to keep them from talking in these channels, but <code>@Silence</code> can override these permissions and ensure they can't speak in any channel without having to mess up anyone's assigned roles.</p><p>The bot detects a raid if <code>N</code> joins happen within <code>M</code> seconds. It's usually configured to be something like <code>3</code> joins in a <code>90</code> second interval for an active server. When this happens, the server enters <strong>raid mode</strong>, which automatically removes <code>@Member</code> from all the users that just triggered the raid alert. It sends a message pinging the moderators in <code>#Moderator Channel</code> and stops adding <code>@Member</code> to anyone who joins while it is still in raid mode. It also changes the server verification level, which actually does have an effect for the newly joined members, because they haven't had any roles assigned to them yet. Moderators can either cancel the raid alert, which automatically adds <code>@Member</code> to everyone who was detected as part of the raid alert, or they can individually add <code>@Member</code> to people they have vetted. The raid mode automatically ends after <code>M*2</code> seconds, which would be <code>180</code> in this example. A moderator can use a command to ban everyone who joined during the raid alert, or they can selectively add <code>@Member</code> to users who should be let in.</p><p>This method of dealing with raids ensures that the bot cannot be overwhelmed by the sheer number of joins. If it crashes or is taken down, the server stays in raid mode until the bot can recover, and the potential raiders will not be allowed in.</p><h2 id=pressure-system>Pressure System</h2><p>All the anti-spam logic in the bot is done by triggering an automatic silence, which gives someone the <code>@Silence</code> role. The bot determines when to silence someone by analyzing all the messages being sent using a pressure system. In essence, the pressure system is analogous to the gravity function used for calculating the &ldquo;hotness&rdquo; of a given post on a site like <a href=https://medium.com/hacking-and-gonzo/how-hacker-news-ranking-algorithm-works-1d9b0cf2c08d>Hacker News</a>.</p><p>Each message a user sends is assigned a &ldquo;pressure score&rdquo;. This is calculated from the message length, contents, whether it matches a filter, how many newlines it has, etc. This &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; is designed to simulate how <em>disruptive</em> the message is to the current chat. A wall of text is extremely disruptive, whereas saying &ldquo;hi&rdquo; probably isn't. Attaching 3 images to your message is very disruptive, but embedding a single link isn't that bad. Sending a blank message with 2000 newlines is <em>incredibly</em> disruptive, whereas sending a message with two paragraphs is probably fine. In addition, all messages are assigned a <em>base pressure</em>, the minimum amount of pressure that any message will have, even if it's only a single letter.</p><p>My bot looks at the following values:</p><ul><li><strong>Max Pressure</strong>: The default maximum pressure is 60.</li><li><strong>Base Pressure</strong>: All messages generate 10 pressure by default, so at most 6 messages can be sent at once.</li><li><strong>Embed Pressure</strong>: Each image, link, or attachment in a message generates 8.3 additional pressure, which limits users to 5 images or links in a single message.</li><li><strong>Length Pressure</strong>: Each individual character in a message generates 0.00625 additional pressure, which limits you to sending 2 maximum length messages at once.</li><li><strong>Line Pressure</strong>: Each newline in a message generates 0.714 additional pressure, which limits you to 70 newlines in a single message.</li><li><strong>Ping Pressure</strong>: Every single <em>unique</em> ping in a message generates 2.5 additional pressure, which limits users to 20 pings in a single message.</li><li><strong>Repeat Pressure</strong>: If the message being sent is the <em>exact</em> same as the previous message sent by this user (copy+pasted), it generates 10 additional pressure, effectively doubling the base pressure cost for the message. This means a user copy and pasting the same message more than twice in rapid succession will be silenced.</li><li><strong>Filter Pressure</strong>: Any filter set by the admins can add an arbitrary amount of additional pressure if a message triggers that filter regex. The amount is user-configurable.</li></ul><p>And here a simplified version of my implementation. Note that I am adding the pressure piecewise, so that I can alert the moderators and tell them exactly which pressure trigger broke the limit, which helps moderators tell if someone just posted too many pictures at once, or was spamming the same message over and over:<pre class=language-go><code>if w.AddPressure(info, m, track, info.Config.Spam.BasePressure) {
	return true
}
if w.AddPressure(info, m, track, info.Config.Spam.EmbedPressure*float32(len(m.Attachments))) {
	return true
}
if w.AddPressure(info, m, track, info.Config.Spam.EmbedPressure*float32(len(m.Embeds))) {
	return true
}
if w.AddPressure(info, m, track, info.Config.Spam.LengthPressure*float32(len(m.Content))) {
	return true
}
if w.AddPressure(info, m, track, info.Config.Spam.LinePressure*float32(strings.Count(m.Content, &#34;\n&#34;))) {
	return true
}
if w.AddPressure(info, m, track, info.Config.Spam.PingPressure*float32(len(m.Mentions))) {
	return true
}
if len(m.Content) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; m.Content == track.lastcache {
	if w.AddPressure(info, m, track, info.Config.Spam.RepeatPressure) {
		return true
	}
}</code></pre>Once we've calculated how disruptive a given message is, we can add it to the user's total pressure score, which is a measure of how disruptive a user is currently being. However, we need to recognize that sending a wall of text every 10 minutes probably isn't an issue, but sending 10 short messages saying &ldquo;ROFLCOPTER&rdquo; in 10 seconds is definitely spamming. So, before we add the message pressure to the user's pressure, we check how long it's been since that user last sent a message, and <em>decrease their pressure accordingly</em>. If it's only been a second, the pressure shouldn't decrease very much, but if it's been 3 minutes or so, any pressure they used to have should probably be gone by now. Most heat algorithms do this non-linearly, but my experiments showed that a linear drop-off tends to produce better results (and is simpler to implement).</p><p>My bot implements this by simply decreasing the amount of pressure a user has by a set amount for every <code>N</code> seconds. So if it's been 2 seconds, they will lose <code>4</code> pressure, until it reaches zero. Here is the implementation for my bot, which is done before any pressure is added:<br><pre class=language-go><code>timestamp := bot.GetTimestamp(m)
track := w.TrackUser(author, timestamp)
last := track.lastmessage
track.lastmessage = timestamp.Unix()*1000 + int64(timestamp.Nanosecond()/1000000)
if track.lastmessage &lt; last { // This can happen because discord has a bad habit of re-sending timestamps if anything so much as touches a message
	track.lastmessage = last
	return false // An invalid timestamp is never spam
}
interval := track.lastmessage - last

track.pressure -= info.Config.Spam.BasePressure * (float32(interval) / (info.Config.Spam.PressureDecay * 1000.0))
if track.pressure &lt; 0 {
	track.pressure = 0
}</code></pre>In essence, this entire system is a superset of the more simplistic &ldquo;<code>N</code> messages in <code>M</code> seconds&rdquo;. If you only use base pressure and maximum pressure, then these determine the absolute upper limit of how many messages can be send in a given time period, regardless of their content. You then tweak the rest of the pressure values to more quickly catch obvious instances of spamming. The maximum pressure can be altered on a per-channel basis, which allows meme channels to spam messages without triggering anti-spam. Here's what a user's pressure value looks like over time:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:481px><a href=/img/pressure.png target=_blank><img src=/img/pressure.png alt="Pressure Graph" width=100%></a></div><p>Because this whole pressure system is integrated into the Regex filtering module, servers can essentially create their own bad-word filters by assigning a huge pressure value to a certain match, which instantly creates a silence. These regexes can be used to look for other things that the bot doesn't currently track, like all-caps messages, or for links to specific websites. The pressure system allows integrating all of these checks in a unified way that represents the total &ldquo;disruptiveness&rdquo; of an individual user's behavior.</p><h2 id=worst-case-scenario>Worst Case Scenario</h2><p>A special mention should go to the uncommon but possible worst-case scenario for spamming. This happens when a dedicated attacker really, really wants to fuck up your server for some reason. They can do this by creating 1000+ fake accounts with randomized names, and wait until they've all been on discord for long enough that the &ldquo;new to discord&rdquo; message doesn't show up. Then, they have the bots join the server <em>extremely slowly</em>, at the pace of maybe 1 per hour. Then they wait another week or so, before they unleash a spam attack that has each account send exactly 1 message, followed by a different account sending another message.</p><p>If they do this fast enough, you can detect it simply by the sheer volume of messages being sent in the channel, and automatically put the channel in slow mode. However, in principle, it is completely impossible to automatically deal with this attack. Banning everyone who happens to be sending messages during the spam event will ban innocent bystanders, and if the individual accounts aren't sending messages that fast (maybe one per second), this is indistinguishable from a normal rapid-fire conversation.</p><p>My bot has an emergency method for dealing with this where it tracks when a given user sent their first message in the server. You can then use a command to ban everyone who sent their first message in the past <code>N</code> seconds. This is very effective when it works, but it is trivial for spammers to get past once they realize what's going on - all they need to do is have their fake accounts say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; once while they're trickling in. Of course, a bunch of accounts all saying &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and then nothing else may raise enough suspicion to catch the attack before it happens.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully this article demonstrates how to make a reliable, extensible anti-spam bot that can deal with pretty much any imaginable spam attack. The code for my deprecated spam bot is <a href=https://github.com/ErikMcClure/sweetiebot>available here</a> for reference, but the code is terrible and most of it was a bad idea. You cannot add the bot itself to a server anymore, and the support channel is no longer accessible.</p><p>My hope is that someone can use these guidelines to build a much more effective anti-spam bot, and release me from my torment. I hate web development and I'd rather spend my time building a native webassembly compiler instead of worrying about <a href=https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/issues/659>weird intermittent cloudflare errors</a> that temporarily break everything, or <a href=https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/issues/513>badly designed lock systems</a> that deadlock under rare edge cases. Godspeed, bot developers.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2020-01-15T21:45:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots/>January 15, 2020 at 9:45pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/pressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fpressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Pressure%20Based%20Anti-Spam%20for%20Discord%20Bots&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fpressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fpressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fpressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/name-shadowing-should-be-an-operator/>Name Shadowing Should Be An Operator</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>I recently discovered that in Rust, this is a relatively common operation:<pre class=language-rust><code>let foo = String::from(&#34;foo&#34;);
// stuff that needs ownership
let foo = &amp;foo;  
</code></pre>Or this:<pre class=language-rust><code>let mut vec = Vec::new();
vec.push(&#34;a&#34;);
vec.push(&#34;b&#34;);
let vec = vec; /* vec is immutable now */  
</code></pre>This is a particularly permissive form of <strong>name-shadowing</strong>, which allows you to re-declare a variable in an inner scope that <em>shadows</em> the name of a variable in an outer scope, making the outer variable inaccessible. Almost every single programming language in common use allows you to do this in some form or another. Rust goes a step further and lets you re-declare a variable <em>inside the same scope</em> as another variable.</p><p>This, to me, is pretty terrifying, because name-shadowing itself is often a dangerous operation. 90% of the time, name-shadowing causes problems with either temporary or index variables, such as <code>i</code>. These are all cases where almost you never want to name-shadow anything and doing so is probably a mistake.<pre class=language-cpp><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; width; ++i)
{
  for(int j = 0; j &lt; height; ++j)
  {
    //
    // lots of unrelated code
    //
    
    float things[4] = {1,2,3,4};
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i)
    	box[i][j] += things[i] // oops!
    //      ^ that is the wrong variable!
  }
}
</code></pre>These errors almost always crop up in complex for loop scenarios, which can obviously be avoided with iterators, but this isn't always an option, espiecally in a lower-level systems programming language like Rust. Even newer languages like Go make it alarmingly easy to name-shadow, although they make it a lot harder to accidentally shoot yourself because unused variables are a compiler error:<pre class=language-rust><code>foo, err := func()
if err != nil {
	err := bar(foo) // error: err is not used
}
println(err)
</code></pre>Unfortunately, Rust doesn't have this error, only an <code>unused-variables</code> linter warning. If you want, you can add <code>#![deny(clippy::shadow_unrelated)]</code> to be warned about name-shadowing. However, a lot of Rust idioms <em>depend</em> on the ability to name-shadow, because Rust does a lot of type-reassignment, where the contents of a variable don't change, but in a particular scope, the known type of the variable has changed to something more specific.<pre class=language-rust><code>let foo = Some(5);
match foo {
    Some(foo) =&gt; println!(&#34;{}&#34;, foo),
    None =&gt; {},
}
</code></pre>Normally, in C++, I avoid name-shadowing at all costs, but this is partially because C++ shadowing rules are unpredictable or counter-intuitive. Rust, however, seems to have legitimate use cases for name-shadowing, which would be reasonable if name-shadowing could be made more explicit.</p><p>I doubt Rust would want to change it's syntax, but if I were to work on a new language, I would define an explicit <strong>name-shadowing operator</strong>, either as a keyword or as an operator. This operator would redefine a variable as a new type and throw a compiler error if there is no existing variable to redefine. Attempting to redefine a variable without this operator would also throw a compiler error, so you'd have something like:<pre class=language-rust><code>let foo = String::from(&#34;foo&#34;);
// stuff that needs ownership
foo := &amp;foo;
</code></pre>Or alternatively:<pre class=language-rust><code>let mut vec = Vec::new();
vec.push(&#34;a&#34;);
vec.push(&#34;b&#34;);
shadow vec = vec; /* vec is immutable now */
</code></pre>While the <code>:=</code> operator is cleaner, the <code>shadow</code> keyword would be easier to embed in other constructions:<pre class=language-rust><code>let foo = Some(5);
match foo {
    Some(shadow foo) =&gt; println!(&#34;{}&#34;, foo),
    None =&gt; {},
}
</code></pre>Which method would depend on the idiomatic constructions in the language syntax, but by making name-shadowing an explicit, rather than an implicit action, this allows you to get the benefits of name-shadowing while eliminating most of the dangerous situations it can create.</p><p>Unfortunately, most modern language design seems hostile to any feature that even slightly inconveniences a developer for the sake of code safety and reliability. Perhaps a new language in the future will take these lessons to heart, but in the meantime, people will continue complaining about unstable software, at least until we put the &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; back in &ldquo;software engineering&rdquo;.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2019-10-13T13:23:58-07:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a
