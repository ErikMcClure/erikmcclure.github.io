Many people point out that you don't really <em>need</em> an RSS feed for either service, since the content they generate is not particularly conducive to an RSS feed. While this is strictly true if you are attempting to read the actual RSS feed, I don't consider this the primary benefit of an RSS feed.</p><p>RSS feeds provide a way to broadcast data in a standard format, which then allows an application to be quickly constructed using an RSS parser to process that data. Since its an open standard, efficient, open-source RSS parsers propagate rapidly. This allows creative use of RSS feeds to comb vastly different types of media, and more importantly <em>allows inter-site integration</em> through a single API. That is, if you publish your blog on an RSS feed, scrapers on Last.fm can pick it up and display it on your artist page. The reason RSS is so valuable is because it provides a standard method of communicating contextualized data over the web.</p><p>An interesting consequence is that few people actually benefit from the human-readability of RSS. Hence, if there is ever an RSS 3.0, it would benefit greatly from a compressed machine version (perhaps utilizing something like Google's <a href=http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/>protocol buffers</a>) for fast and efficient data transfer. Proper caching is also important, so an RSS feed is only served up when its been updated. Being able to directly indicate data formats like video and mp3 would also help to enforce more global methods of parsing them (an example being the very useful RSS feed that Newgrounds provides on <a href=http://rss.ngfiles.com/users/1743000/erikmcclure/audio/>my audio page</a>). This is a more general problem with XML based formats, however, and is best left for a separate debate.</p><p>Either way, while RSS as a standard publication method may be dying, the internet must strive to keep it available for API developers, because <strong>RSS promotes freedom of information</strong> by providing an easy way to process that information. The interconnectivity of the internet and the freedom of information that it experiences cannot be provided by a proprietary protocol. RSS hasn't even gotten near its full potential and its already dying. Do your part to save RSS by making your website's information accessible via RSS, even if its only in the metadata. The user interface to RSS may be facing extinction, but the information parsing it provides must not be allowed to die.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-05-08T22:03:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/save-rss/>May 8, 2011 at 10:03pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/save-rss/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fsave-rss%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Save%20RSS&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fsave-rss%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fsave-rss%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fsave-rss%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/college-is-broken/>College Is Broken</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>The reason I have been repeatedly rejected from the computer science major at my college is partly due to underfunded and crowded conditions, but primarily because they are letting in the wrong students. Apparently, had I gotten a 3.5 in all of my classes, I would have been in the major already. Because I instead got a 4.0 in one class and a 3.0 in another, they have rejected me. Why? Because when funding gets tight, they simply throw out anyone with inconsistent grades. Nevermind that half the time people with inconsistent grades are the ones actually passionate about something, while the people with rock solid consistent grades are simply good at getting rock solid consistent grades and don't actually really know what they want to do, but heard that programming pays well.</p><p>Nevermind that Math 308 has been shown as the best indicator of success in computer science related math courses and I got a 3.9 in it, which is apparently very hard to do. Nevermind that the professor I talked to had tried to convince the committee to weigh student grades differently in an effort to improve the process but was ignored. Instead, I am to whore myself out to a bunch of grad students because no one wants to look at the paper I wrote until I help a bunch of other people with their papers.</p><p>Wow, this sounds familiar. It's kind of like that academic ponzi scheme everyone's been complaining about recently. I have to get involved in this just to get into a major to take some classes? Is this worth my time?</p><p>Sony can't do basic security. Modern games are made of brown. User interfaces are rarely built in a user-centric fashion. Academic insistence that performance doesn't matter dominates everything to the point that horrifically bad code is being put into production and customers are told to get new computers. These people have all gone to college, and this is the resulting mess?</p><p>I have seen many people defend academic rigor, but I believe there is a point where it becomes utterly stupid. When rigor only exists in theoretical thesis papers, the second some guy actually runs a company with a decent idea, and doesn't screw it up, you end up with Google because they exploited an economic disparity worth hundreds of billions of dollars, created by this insane educational system that is too self-absorbed to figure out how utterly broken it is.</p><p>Google changed everything.</p><p>The theoretical papers, meanwhile, are still just papers.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-05-03T21:08:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/college-is-broken/>May 3, 2011 at 9:08pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/college-is-broken/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;1 comment</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcollege-is-broken%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=College%20Is%20Broken&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcollege-is-broken%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcollege-is-broken%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fcollege-is-broken%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/outside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco/>An Outside Perspective on the PSN Fiasco</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>I asked a non-technical friend of mine, who has been unable to play online with his PS3 recently due to the PSN outage, what he thought about practically all of his personal information being compromised due to an intrusion and questionable security.

There is a lot of stigma against taking the network down, for any reason, due to the competition and entitlement of their fanbase and others, but honestly I'd have preferred this be the result after the Anonymous attack, even if everyone would've just bitched then too.</p><p>So there, I'm not the happiest with this, but I'm not freaking out or anything, because it doesn't surprise me one bit, it's just inconvinient for Portal and&mldr; well, the guy I wanted to play that with isn't getting it anytime soon so co-op's going to be me being an idiot with someone who's done it 90 times by the time I get it working no matter what, so it kinda sucks anyway.</p><p>Naturally, he carries some misconceptions. Anonymous did not hack the network, it took it down with a DDoS attack. But, he didn't even panic then even though he assumed it had been hacked and his credentials potentially stolen. He never panicked during any of this because <em>he has never had any reason to believe that anything he is using is secure</em>, although he hopes that PayPal has good enough security to keep him reasonably protected.</p><p>I see people in Hacker News lashing out at the video game fanboys as being clueless and only caring about being able to play their games, but the truth of the matter is that, in the perspective of a consumer, <strong>online security just flat out sucks</strong>. Its rarely implemented properly and even when it is it often fails eventually at some point, which of course everyone hears about. Sony happens to <a href=http://psx-scene.com/forums/f177/sony-has-been-bad-boy-ridiculous-levels-spying-81093/>really suck at security</a>, but its just another hacking incident to most of the PSN users. They simply never assumed that the network was secure <em>in the first place</em>. Even if they wanted to switch to say, Xbox Live, they can't, because Sony has a monopoly on the games offered on the PS3. The fact that Sony still has a very large chunk of the market isn't necessarily because consumers are stupid (although some of them clearly are), but because it has a monopoly on game selection. You can teach someone about why good security is important, but it won't matter until they have an alternative platform on which to play their games.</p><p>So the real problem here is that, from an economic perspective, games should not be limited to a single console, because it creates a monopoly and prevents proper competition. If you want to blame something for this, <em>blame the monopoly</em>, not the customers. The real lesson here is not that Sony is terrible at security, but that we have allowed a dangerous monopoly to form. In a proper competitive environment, Sony would lose an absurd chunk of its customers after an incident like this. You can complain that the company is evil and the customers are stupid, but at the end of the day, its just economics.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-04-26T21:11:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/outside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco/>April 26, 2011 at 9:11pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/outside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2foutside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=An%20Outside%20Perspective%20on%20the%20PSN%20Fiasco&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2foutside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2foutside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2foutside-perspective-on-psn-fiasco%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/future-predictions/>Future Predictions</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>In the past I've made several predictions that were dismissed, at the time, as ludicrous, but have in fact come to fruition, like the importance of having dynamic environments in games and graphics engines that can handle it. So, here I present a complete list of all the computer-related or economic predictions I currently have, along with justification:</p><p><strong>Speed becomes paramount to all mature markets</strong>: People have been ignoring speed for as long as they can, because its apparently rather difficult for programmers to properly optimize programs. This is fine in emerging markets because no one knows how fast things can go. However, the more mature a market gets, the faster the consumer will notice speed problems - even little ones. People are really impatient, and a program that successfully combines both ease of use and extremely fast calculations will win over a bloated, slow, feature-filled one. This has become markedly apparent in the current cycle of web applications, and will soon spill over into just about everything that we use.</p><p>Arguments against this usually say that a faster processor will make slow programs go away, and that algorithms are the only things that make significant speed differences. There are a lot of technical reasons I could go into concerning why this is wrong, but there's a much easier argument: Why have my programs gotten slower over the years as my processor speed has increased? Because programmers are getting too lazy. In fact, most of the speed increases over the years have been due to algorithmic optimizations, and yet&mldr; programs are still slow. The amount of speed you can now gain over properly building an architecture and optimizing your program is so incredibly large that it is noticeable even for comparatively large computational tasks, and hence represents an economic benefit that has yet to be exploited. It's a little more complicated then simply making fast programs, however, involving a combination of user friendliness, speed, and avoiding feature bloat. <strong>The myth that speed doesn't matter in programming, however, is about to start costing companies serious money if they continue to believe it.</strong></p><p><strong>Rasterization won't get replaced by ray-tracing</strong>: Or rather, it won't get replaced any time soon. There are a lot of incredibly annoying computational issues with raytracing, and a lot of them can actually be solved by <em>combining</em> both techniques. As a result, what will happen is a slow evolution, where ray-tracing will slowly work its way into rasterization pipelines, likely starting with variable density volumetric entities, until it eventually replaces rasterization altogether once we have more computational power then we know what to do with. This probably won't happen for another 20 years, though.</p><p>A lot of people argue that we can do impressive amounts of raytracing even with modern computing power, and that the increased parallelism in CPUs 20 years from now will result in feasible realtime raytracing engines that can compete with modern rasterization very well. There are two problems with this: The first is that they are ignoring the fact that rasterization itself <em>also</em> benefits from parallelism, and as such it's rendering quality will increase as computing power does. This usually leads into the second mistake: people argue that rasterization will simply hit a ceiling and be unable to get past it, and only raytracing can produce true photorealism. These people completely fail to understand just how much stuff can be efficiently accomplished using rasterization, and also do not understand how raytracing can be combined with rasterization to achieve almost the same amount of realism for a tiny fraction of the computing cost. Other people just don't understand how computationally expensive the tiny nuances of photorealism are.</p><p><strong>Low-level languages will become even more important</strong>: Lots of people want low-level languages to vanish, but due to the above speed concerns, that simply isn't going to happen. However, business moves too fast for people to worry about low-level routines all the time, so what will happen is an increasing chasm between high speed low-level languages that are dependent on high-level languages to do complex tasks, while the high-level languages will be increasingly dependent on low-level libraries in order to deliver effective performance. Hence, language interoperability becomes incredibly important, because the programs of the future will likely be written in 2 or more languages. The ability to simply pick a language as a tool, choosing it based on what problem needs to be solved, will become invaluable. This is likely to happen very quickly, in just 5 or 10 years. At the same time, this increasingly wide division between high level and low level languages will create a vacuum that needs to be filled by&mldr;</p><p><strong>Middle-level languages</strong>: A middle-level language will be a language that allows a programmer to quickly and efficiently write a method either in the style of low-level memory management, or high-level complexity management. This would likely be accomplished with something like D, where the programmer would be able to control and override the high-level garbage collectors and variable management whenever they desire, with little to no resistance from the language syntax. While many high-level languages today attempt to make some low-level functions available, it is often clumsy and far from complete. This language would act as an intermediate compromise between the necessary low level speed hogs and high level complexity management. This transition, however, is not going to happen for probably another 10 or 20 years, due to people needing to recognize that there is a schism in the first place, along with several engineering problems that must be confronted.</p><p><strong>Education will soon fundamentally change</strong>: We've been using the same, outdated rote methods of teaching for almost 150 years, slapping on in-place attempts at more modern learning, trying to work such fundamentally incompatible methods into the existing framework that refuses to change. It is becoming so economically irrational for people to continue being schooled this way that the instant an alternative comes up, it will rapidly displace the existing system. This is already happening at a small level with Khan Academy, which I believe is precipitating a fundamental change in how we learn things. We aren't there yet and we probably won't be for say, 2-3 decades, but around that time we will see a huge shift in the educational paradigm.</p><p><strong>Anti-authoritarianism becomes rampant</strong>: This one probably won't happen for a good 50 years, but the inklings of its beginnings have already shown up, primarily in Anonymous and the multiple middle-east government coups. Anonymous will end up being one of the most important social movements in modern history, as it matures from a group of pranksters into something that unites a large portion of humanity together. Governments will be forced to become more transparent and accountable, and debates about the effectiveness of representative democracy will rage in internet forums or whatever the future equivalent is. Part of this change will likely be influenced by a changing educational system that becomes much more effective at promoting critical thinking and individualistic problem solving skills. Extreme anti-authoritarianism, including anarchy, will become far more vocal and possibly less ignored by the public, but by necessity will remain fringe groups.</p><p><strong>The economy will become both more capitalistic and more socialist</strong>: This is not a contradiction. The huge disparity between the wealthy and the poor is reaching such an absurd level in the United States that it has created an economic disparity that can be taken advantage of. At the same time, the most successful companies are already beginning to realize that increasing competition and other capitalistic values inside their own corporations results in far more productivity and efficiency (just look at what Larry Page is doing at Google). That means that capitalistic values will become more pronounced at smaller and smaller economic tiers, while the economy at large takes on a more socialistic approach to even out the wealth distribution. I have no idea when this will happen, because it is dependent on the two arguing political parties in the united states to realize that they both want the <em>same wealth distribution</em>. They just have to stop arguing and come to a compromise to try and do something about it.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>So there you have it, my predictions for the future. Some of them might be right, others might not, others might be influenced by me planning to directly instigate them, but hopefully this was an interesting read nonetheless.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-04-17T15:54:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/future-predictions/>April 17, 2011 at 3:54pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/future-predictions/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffuture-predictions%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Future%20Predictions&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffuture-predictions%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffuture-predictions%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://plus.google.com/share?app=110&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffuture-predictions%2f','popup','width=400,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="4 2 52.6934 50.6934" class="icon-img" height="24"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><g><path class="st0" d="M19.6671 25.7867c-.0075 1.7935.0 3.5869.0076 5.3803 3.0067.098 6.0208.0527 9.0275.098-1.3262 6.6689-10.3989 8.8315-15.199 4.4761C8.5674 31.9206 8.801 23.5412 13.9327 19.992c3.5869-2.8635 8.6884-2.1552 12.2752.324 1.4092-1.3036 2.7278-2.6977 4.0013-4.1445-2.984-2.3812-6.6462-4.0767-10.5421-3.8958-8.1307-.2713-15.6059 6.8497-15.7415 14.9805-.52 6.6462 3.8506 13.1644 10.0222 15.5155 6.1489 2.3661 14.031.7535 17.957-4.77 2.5922-3.4889 3.1498-7.98 2.8484-12.1999C29.7194 25.7641 24.6933 25.7716 19.6671 25.7867z"/><path class="st0" d="M49.0704 25.7641c-.0151-1.4996-.0226-3.0067-.0301-4.5062-1.4996.0-2.9916.0-4.4836.0-.0151 1.4996-.0301 2.9991-.0377 4.5062-1.5071.0075-3.0067.0151-4.5062.0302.0 1.4995.0 2.9915.0 4.4836 1.4995.0151 3.0066.0302 4.5062.0452.0151 1.4996.0151 2.9991.0302 4.4987 1.4996.0 2.9916.0 4.4911.0.0075-1.4996.015-2.9991.0301-4.5062 1.5071-.0151 3.0067-.0226 4.5062-.0377.0-1.4921.0-2.9916.0-4.4836C52.0771 25.7792 50.57 25.7792 49.0704 25.7641z"/></g></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/investigating-low-level-cpu-performance/>Investigating Low-level CPU Performance</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>While reconstructing my threaded Red-Black tree data structure, I naturally assumed that due to invalid branch predictions costing significant amounts of performance, by eliminating branching in low-level data structures, one can significant enhance the performance of your application.

</code></pre><p>Now, those of you familiar with CPU branching and other low-level optimizations might point out that the compiler may have optimized the old code path more effectively, leaving the new code path with extra instructions due to the extra increment and bitshift operations. <strong>Wrong.</strong> Both code paths have the <em>exact same number of instructions</em>. Furthermore, there are only <em><strong>FOUR</strong></em> instructions that are different between the two implementations (highlighted in red below).</p><span><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><b>New</b><pre>00F72DE5  mov         esi,dword ptr [esp+38h]

As a result, it may be possible for the CPU to be doing branch prediction in such a way it shaves off one instruction, which gives it a significant advantage. It may also be that the branching is just <em>faster</em> then my increment and bitshift, although I find this highly unlikely. At this point I was wondering if anything I knew about optimization held any meaning in the real world, or if everything was just a lot of guesswork and profiling because <em>what the fuck?!</em> However, it then occurred to me that there was an optimization possible for the old version - Move the if(c==0) statement to the bottom so the CPU does the (c&lt;0) and (c>0) comparisons first, since the c==0 comparison only happens once in the traversal. Naturally I was a bit skeptical of this having any effect on the assembly-rewriting, branch-predicting, impulsive teenage bitch that my CPU was at this point, but I tried it anyway.</p><p>It worked. There was a small but noticeable improvement in running time by using the old technique and rewriting the if statements as such:<pre class=language-cpp><code>c = C(key, y-&gt;_key);
if (c &lt; 0)  y = y-&gt;_left;
else if(c &gt; 0) y = y-&gt;_right;
else return y;
</code></pre></p><p>Optimized: 610161.8 Ticks</p><p>The total performance improvement over my failed optimization attempt and my more successful branch-manipulation technique is a whopping 63838.2 Ticks, or a ~10% improvement in speed, caused by simply rearranging 4 or 5 instructions. These tests were done on a randomized collection of 500000 integers, so that means the optimized version can pack in 10% more comparisons in the same period of time as the bad optimization. That's 550000 vs 500000 elements, which seems to suggest that delicate optimization, even in modern CPUs, can have significant speed improvements. Those of you who say that toying around with low level code can't infer significant performance increases should probably reconsider exactly what you're claiming. This wouldn't directly translate to 50000 extra players on your server, but a 10% increase in speed isn't statistically insignificant.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate
