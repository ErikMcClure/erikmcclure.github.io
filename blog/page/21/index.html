I have given out quite a bit of criticism myself, but after discovering that most people aren't interested in brutally honest opinions, I have since avoided it. However, one thing that continues to come up over and over again is someone complaining about Genres.</p><p>&ldquo;This is too fast to be trance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This isn't real Drum'n'Bass.&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes people will even slam entire swathes of subgenres, like <a href=http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/>Ishkur's rant</a> on Epic Trance (and by extension almost anything related to it), literally accusing it as betraying the entire idea of trance: <em>&ldquo;There must be a word to describe the pain one feels when witnessing (or hearing, rather) something once pure and brilliant completely sold down the river. Sometime in the mid-90s trance decided to drop the technique of slowly introducing complicated layers and building adequate tension over long stretches, replacing them with cutesy little insta-melodies &mldr; The average attention span, way too ritalin-freaked to pay attention to the slow, brooding trance in its original form, liked the anthemic singalong tone of the NEW McTrance, and that's why all you trance crackers are reading this right now. Not because you grew a taste for this super awesome underground music &mldr; But because trance reformed its sound and delivery to suit [YOU]."</em></p><p>This is repeated for something like half the listed subgenres of trance, and in fact the entire trance genre in his &ldquo;Guide&rdquo; is just one giant extended rant about how Trance sucks now and it used to be awesome and now we've all ruined it forever.</p><p>This kind of stuck-up, bigoted, brain-melting stupidity has grated against my nerves for years, half because I just don't like stupid stuck-up dipshits, but mostly because it is simply <em>wrong</em>.</p><p><strong>Genres do not define music</strong>. Genres were invented so people could find music similar to songs that they liked. That's all. There are no rules for any genre other than &ldquo;it should sound kind of like other songs in said genre&rdquo;, and even then it's commonplace to have songs associated with multiple genres. Genres are a categorization system, and nothing else. Many people try and justify their opinions by saying that they're criticizing the classification of the song instead of the song itself, and suggesting that it should be put in some kind of subgenre instead. When the inevitable subgenre usually fails to exist because the composer is being creative like their <strong>supposed to</strong>, they'll suggest something asinine, like &ldquo;put it in Miscellaneous, that's what its there for.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Really?</em> Put this <em>obviously</em> heavily drum'n'bass influenced song in Miscellaneous with a bunch of off-the-wall experimental stuff instead of songs that, you know, actually <em>sound like it</em>, just because it doesn't conform to a bunch of imaginary rules you pulled out of your ass to &ldquo;qualify&rdquo; the song for the genre? Well why don't we just invent another subgenre? We've only got like a couple hundred of them now, 80% of which are basically the same damn thing. People try to defend their perceived sanctity of genres, but the problem is that its all bullshit. Let's remind ourselves, why do genres exist?</p><p><strong>Genres exist so people can find songs that sound similar to music they like.</strong> If you have a bajillion subgenres, no one's going to be able to accurately classify every single song into its own little niche, and what's more infuriating is that <em>this misses the point completely</em>. The <strong>vast majority</strong> of people do not have laser-guided musical tastes. They just listen to whatever the heck music they like. If they're looking for a song, they don't want to have to filter through hundreds of meaningless subgenres, because all they're really looking for is something like, Trance, or maybe Melodic Trance, and that's about as qualifying as you can get while still being <em>useful</em>. Consequently if your song is weird, you are better off picking the closest well-known genre of music that it sounds like and slapping it in there.</p><p>And yet, it <em>still doesn't stop</em>. People start throwing on ridiculous prescriptive rules like, a trance song has to be mixable, and to be club friendly you have to have 1 minute of intro with no bass, or it has to be between 116-148 BPM, or you have to use these types of instruments, or you have to do <em>X</em>, or <em>X</em>, or <em>X</em>. Music is <em>art</em>, god damn it, what matters is what a song <em>feels</em> like. If it <em>feels</em> like trance even though its flying along at 166 BPM, and a lot of people who like trance also like that song, then it belongs in trance no matter how much you complain about it. Maybe stick it in &ldquo;Energy Trance&rdquo;, it kinda gets the idea across, but its still Trance, so who cares, and even then this point is usually moot, because these arguments always come up on websites with either a set list of genres, or one that operates on keywords. In the former case, you can't qualify your genre with anything more than &ldquo;trance&rdquo; because the only thing they offer is &ldquo;Trance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Techno&rdquo;. In the latter case, you'll have to tag it with Trance no matter what you do because otherwise no one will ever know your song exists.</p><p>Attacking a song because of its perceived genre is the dumbest, most useless criticism you can ever give, unless the artist explicitly states that they are trying for a very specific sound, and even then its rarely a genre and usually more of an abstract concept used across several subgenres, in which case you should be referring to the idea, not the genre. People need to understand that if I slap a &ldquo;Trance&rdquo; label on to my song, it doesn't automatically mean I am trying to make whatever anglicized version of &ldquo;Trance&rdquo; they have deluded themselves into thinking encapsulates the entire genre (which is completely different from everyone else's), it is simply there to help them <strong>find the damn song</strong>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-09-01T16:29:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/musical-genres/>September 1, 2011 at 4:29pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/musical-genres/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmusical-genres%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Musical%20Genres&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmusical-genres%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmusical-genres%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/>C# to C++ Tutorial - Part 2: Pointers Everywhere!</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>[ <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/>1</a> · <strong>2</strong> · <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-3-classes-and/>3</a> · <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-4-operator-overload/>4</a> · 5 · 6 · 7 ]</p><p>We still have a lot of ground to cover on pointers, but before we do, we need to address certain conceptual frameworks missing from C# that one must be intimately familiar with when moving to C++.</p><p>Specifically, in C# you mostly work with the <strong>Heap</strong>. The heap is not difficult to understand - its a giant lump of memory that you take chunks out of to allocate space for your classes. Anything using the <code>new</code> keyword is allocated on the heap, which ends up being almost everything in a C# program. However, the heap isn't the only source of memory - there is also the <strong>Stack</strong>. The Stack is best described as what your program lives inside of. I've said before that everything takes up memory, and yes, that includes your program. The thing is that the Heap is inherently dynamic, while the Stack is inherently <em>fixed</em>. Both can be re-purposed to do the opposite, but trying to get the Stack to do dynamic allocation is extremely dangerous and is almost guaranteed to open up a mile-wide security hole.</p><p>I'm going to assume that a C# programmer knows what a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure)>stack</a> is. All you need to understand is that absolutely every single piece of data that isn't allocated on the heap is pushed or popped off your program's stack. That's why most debuggers have a &ldquo;stack&rdquo; of functions that you can go up and down. Understanding the stack in terms of how many functions you're inside of is ok, but in reality, there are also variables declared on the stack, including every single parameter passed to a function. It is important that you understand how variable scope works so you can take advantage of declaring things on the stack, and know when your stack variables will simply vanish into nothingness. This is where <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> come in.</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int bunny = 1;
  
  {
    int carrot=3;
    int lettuce=8;
    bunny = 2; // Legal
  }

  //carrot=2; //Compiler error: carrot does not exist
  int carrot = 3; //Legal, since the other carrot no longer exists
  
  {
    int lettuce = 0;

    { 
       //int carrot = 1; //Compiler error: carrot already defined
       int grass = 9;
       
       bunny = grass; //Still legal
       bunny = carrot; // Also legal
    }
    
    //bunny = grass; //Illegal
    bunny = lettuce; //Legal
  }
  
  //bunny = lettuce; //Illegal
}
</code></pre><code>{</code> and <code>}</code> define <strong>scope</strong>. Anything declared inside of them ceases to exist outside, but is still accessible to any additional layers of scope declared inside of them. This is a way to see your program's stack in action. When <code>bunny</code> is declared, its pushed on to the stack. Then we enter our first scope area, where we push <code>carrot</code> and <code>lettuce</code> on to the stack and set <code>bunny</code> to 2, which is legal because <code>bunny</code> is still on the stack. When the scope is then closed, however, anything declared inside the scope is popped from the stack <em>in the exact opposite order it was pushed on</em>. Unfortunately, compiler optimization might change that order behind the scenes, so <strong>don't rely on it</strong>, but it should be fairly consistent in debug builds. First <code>lettuce</code> is de-allocated (and its destructor called, if it has one), then <code>carrot</code> is de-allocated. Consequently, trying to set <code>carrot</code> to 2 outside of the scope will result in a compiler error, because it doesn't exist anymore. This means we can now declare an entirely new integer variable that is also called <code>carrot</code>, without causing an error. If we visualize this as a stack, that means <code>carrot</code> is now directly above <code>bunny</code>. As we enter a new scope area, <code>lettuce</code> is then put on top of <code>carrot</code>, and then <code>grass</code> is put on top of <code>lettuce</code>. We can still assign either <code>lettuce</code> or <code>carrot</code> to <code>bunny</code>, since they are all on the stack, but once we leave this inner scope, <code>grass</code> is popped off the stack and no longer exists, so any attempt to use it causes an error. <code>lettuce</code>, however, is still there, so we can assign <code>lettuce</code> to <code>bunny</code> before the scope closes, which pops <code>lettuce</code> off the stack.</p><p>Now the only things on the stack are <code>bunny</code> and <code>carrot</code>, in that order (if the compiler hasn't moved things around). We are about to leave the function, and the function is also surrounded by <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. This is because a function is, itself, a scope, so that means all variables declared inside of that scope are also destroyed in the order they were declared in. First <code>carrot</code> is destroyed, then <code>bunny</code> is destroyed, and then the function's parameters <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> are destroyed (however the compiler can push those on to the stack in whatever order it wants, so we don't know the order they get popped off), until finally the <em>function itself</em> is popped off the stack, which returns program flow to whatever called it. In this case, the function was <code>main</code>, so program flow is returned to the parent operating system, which does cleanup and terminates the process.</p><p>You can declare anything that has a size determined at compile time on the stack. This means if you have an array that has a constant size, you can declare it on the stack:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int array[5]; //Array elements are not initialized and therefore are undefined!
int array[5] = {0,0,0,0,0}; //Elements all initialized to 0
//int array[5] = {0}; // Compiler error - your initialization must match the array size
</code></pre>You can also let the compiler infer the size of the array:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int array[] = {1,2,3,4}; //Declares an array of 4 ints on the stack initialized to 1,2,3,4
</code></pre>Not only that, but you can declare class instances and other objects on the stack.</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>Class instance(arg1, arg2); //Calls a constructor with 2 arguments
Class instance; //Used if there are no arguments for the constructor
//Class instance(); //Causes a compiler error! The compiler will think its a function.
</code></pre>In fact, if you have a very simple data structure that uses only default constructors, you can use a shortcut for initializing its members. I haven't gone over classes and structs in C++ yet (See <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-3-classes-and/>Part 3</a>), but here is the syntax anyway:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>struct Simple
{
  int a;
  int b;
  const char* str;
};

Simple instance = { 4, 5, &#34;Sparkles&#34; };
//instance.a is now 4
//instance.b is now 5
//instance.str is now &#34;Sparkles&#34;
</code></pre>All of these declare variables on the stack. C# actually does this with trivial datatypes like <code>int</code> and <code>double</code> that don't require a <code>new</code> statement to allocate, but otherwise forces you to use the Heap so its garbage collector can do the work.</p><p>Wait a minute, stack variables automatically destroy themselves when they go out-of-scope, but how do you delete variables allocated from the Heap? In C#, you didn't need to worry about this because of Garbage Collection, which everyone likes because it reduces memory leaks (but even I have still managed to cause a memory leak in C#). In C++, you must explicitly delete all your variables declared with the <code>new</code> keyword, and you must keep in mind which variables were declared as arrays and which ones weren't. In both C# and C++, there are two uses of the <code>new</code> keyword - instantiating a single object, and instantiating an array. In C++, there are also two uses of the <code>delete</code> keyword - deleting a single object and deleting an array. <strong>You cannot mix up <code>delete</code> statements!</strong></p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int* Fluffershy = new int();
int* ponies = new int[10];

delete Fluffershy; // Correct
//delete ponies; // WRONG, we should be using delete [] for ponies
delete [] ponies; // Just like this
//delete [] Fluffershy; // WRONG, we can&#39;t use delete [] on Fluffershy because we didn&#39;t
                        // allocate it as an array.

int* one = new int[1];

//delete one; // WRONG, just because an array only has one element doesn&#39;t mean you can
              // use the normal delete!
delete [] one; // You still must use delete [] because you used new [] to allocate it.
</code></pre>As you can see, it is much easier to deal with stack allocations, because they are automatically deallocated, even when the function terminates unexpectedly. <code>[std::auto_ptr](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/memory/auto_ptr/)</code> takes advantage of this by taking ownership of a pointer and automatically deleting it when it is destroyed, so you can allocate the <code>auto_ptr</code> on the stack and benefit from the automatic destruction. However, in <code>C++0x</code>, this has been superseded by <code>[std::unique_ptr](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee410601.aspx)</code>, which operates in a similar manner but uses some complex move semantics introduced in the new standard. I won't go into detail about how to use these here as its out of the scope of this tutorial. Har har har.</p><p>For those of you who like throwing exceptions, I should point out common causes of memory leaks. The most common is obviously just flat out forgetting to delete something, which is usually easily fixed. However, consider the following scenario:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void Kenny()
{
  int* kenny = new int();
  throw &#34;BLARG&#34;;
  delete kenny; // Even if the above exception is caught, this line of code is never reached.
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  try {
  Kenny();
  } catch(char * str) { 
    //Gotta catch&#39;em all.
  }
  return 0; //We&#39;re leaking Kenny! o.O
}
</code></pre>Even this is fairly common:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int* kitty = new int();

  *kitty=rand();
  if(*kitty==0)
    return 0; //LEAK
  
  delete kitty;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>These situations <em>seem</em> obvious, but they will happen to you once the code becomes enormous. This is one reason you have to be careful when inside functions that are very large, because losing track of <code>if</code> statements may result in you forgetting what to delete. A good rule of thumb is to make sure you delete everything whenever you have a return statement. However, the opposite can also happen. If you are too vigilant about deleting everything, you might delete something you never allocated, which is just as bad:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int* rarity = new int();
  int* spike;

  if(rarity==NULL)
  {
    spike=new int();
  }
  else
  {
    delete rarity;
    delete spike; // Suddenly, in an alternate dimension, earth ceased to exist
    return 0;
  }
  
  delete rarity; // Since this only happens if the allocation failed and returned a NULL
                 // pointer, this will also blow up.
  delete spike;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>Clearly, one must be careful when dealing with allocating and destroying memory in C++. Its usually best to encapsulate as much as possible in classes that automate such things. But wait, what about that <code>NULL</code> pointer up there? Now that we're familiar with memory management, we're going to dig into pointers again, starting with the <code>NULL</code> pointer.</p><p>Since a pointer points to a piece of memory that's somewhere between 0 and 4294967295, what happens if its pointing at 0? Any pointer to memory location 0 <strong>is always invalid</strong>. All you need to know is that the operating system does some magic voodoo to ensure that any attempted access of memory location 0 will always throw an error, no matter what. 1, 2, 3, and any other double or single digit low numbers are also always invalid. <code>0xfdfdfdfd</code> is what the VC++ debugger sets uninitialized memory to, so that pointer location is also always invalid. A pointer set to 0 is called a <strong>Null Pointer</strong>, and is usually used to signify that a pointer is empty. Consequently if an allocation function fails, it tends to return a null pointer. Null pointers are returned when the operation failed and a valid pointer cannot be returned. Consequently, you may see this:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int* blink = new int();
  if(blink!=0) delete blink;
  blink=0;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>This is known as a <strong>safe deletion</strong>. It ensures that you only delete a pointer if it is valid, and once you delete the pointer you set the pointer to 0 to signify that it is invalid. Note that <code>NULL</code> is defined as 0 in the standard library, so you could also say <code>blink = NULL</code>.</p><p>Since pointers are just integers, we can do <strong>pointer arithmetic</strong>. What happens if you add 1 to a pointer? If you think of pointers as just integers, one would assume it would simply move the pointer forward a single byte.</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:486px><a href=/img/tut2.png target=_blank><img src=/img/tut2.png alt="Moving a Pointer 1 byte" width=100%></a></div><p>This isn't what happens. Adding 1 to a pointer of type <code>integer</code> results in the pointer moving forward 4 bytes.</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:486px><a href=/img/tut3.png target=_blank><img src=/img/tut3.png alt="Moving a Pointer 4 bytes" width=100%></a></div><p><strong>Adding or subtracting an integer $i$ from a pointer moves that pointer $i\cdot n$ bytes, where $n$ is the size, in bytes, of the pointer's type</strong>. This results in an interesting parallel - adding or subtracting from a pointer is the same as treating the pointer as an array and accessing it via an index.</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int* kitties = new int[14];
  int* a = &amp;kitties[7];
  int* b = kitties+7; //b is now the same as a
  int* c = &amp;a[4];
  int* d = b+4; //d is now the same as c
  int* e = &amp;kitties[11];
  int* f = kitties+11; 
  //c,d,e, and f now all point to the same location
}
</code></pre>So pointer arithmetic is identical to accessing a given index and taking the address. But what happens when you try to add two pointers together? Adding two pointers together is undefined because it tends to produce total nonsense. <em>Subtracting</em> two pointers, however, is defined, provided you subtract a smaller pointer from a larger one. The reason this is allowed is so you can do this:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int* eggplants = new int[14];
  int* a = &amp;eggplants[7];
  int* b = eggplants+10;
  int diff = b-a; // Diff is now equal to 3
  a += (diff*2); // adds 6 to a, making it point to eggplants[13]
  diff = a-b; // diff is again equal to 3
  diff = a-eggplants; //diff is now 13
  ++a; //The increment operator is valid on pointers, and operates the same way a += 1 would
  // So now a points to eggplants[14], which is not a valid location, but this is still
  // where the &#34;end&#34; of the array technically is.
  diff = a-eggplants; // Diff now equals 14, the size of the array
  --b; // Decrement works too
  diff = a-b; // a is pointing to index 14, b is pointing to 9, so 14-9 = 5. Diff is now 5.
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>There is a mistake in the code above, can you spot it? I used a <em>signed</em> <code>integer</code> to store the difference between the two pointers. What if one pointer was above 2147483647 and the other was at 0? The difference would overflow! Had I used an unsigned integer to store the difference, I'd have to be really damn sure that the left pointer was larger than the right pointer, or the negative value would <em>also</em> overflow. This complexity is why you have to goad windows into letting your program deal with pointer sizes over 2147483647.</p><p>In addition to arithmetic, one can compare two pointers. We already know we can use <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>, but we can also use <code>&lt; > &lt;=</code> and <code>>=</code>. While you can get away with comparing two completely unrelated pointers, these comparison operators are usually used in a context like the following:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int* teapots = new int[15];
  int* end = teapots+15;
  for(int* s = teapots; s&lt;end; ++s)
    *s = 0;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>Here the for loop increments the pointer itself rather than an index, until the pointer reaches the end, at which point it terminates. But, what if you had a pointer that didn't have any type at all? <code>void*</code> is a legal pointer type, that any pointer type can be implicitly converted to. You can also explicitly cast <code>void*</code> to any pointer type you want, which is why you are allowed to explicitly cast any pointer type to another pointer type (<code>int* p; short* q = (short*)p;</code> is entirely legal). Doing so, however, is obviously dangerous. <code>void*</code> has its own problems, namely, how big is it? The answer is, you don't know. <strong>Any attempt to use any kind of pointer arithmetic with a <code>void*</code> pointer will cause a compiler error</strong>. It is most often used when copying generic chunks of memory that only care about size in bytes, and not what is actually contained in the memory, like <code>memcpy()</code>.</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int* teapots = new int[15];
  void* p = (void*)teapots;
  p++; // compiler error
  unsigned short* d = (unsigned short*)p;
  d++; // No compiler error, but you end up pointing to half an integer
  d = (unsigned short*)teapots; // Still valid
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>Now that we know all about pointer manipulation, we need to look at pointers to pointers, and to anchor this in a context that actually makes sense, we need to look at how C++ does <strong>multidimensional arrays</strong>. In C#, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2yd9wwz4(v=vs.71).aspx">multidimensional arrays</a> look like this:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>int[,] table = new int[4,5];
</code></pre>C++ has a different, but fairly reasonable stack-based syntax. When you want to declare a multidimensional array <em>on the heap</em>, however, things start getting <em>weird</em>:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int unicorns[5][3]; // Well this seems perfectly reasonable, I wonder what-
  int (*cthulu)[50] = new int[10][50]; // OH GOD GET IT AWAY GET IT AWAAAAAY...!
  int c=5;
  int (*cthulu)[50] = new int[c][50]; // legal
  //int (*cthulu)[] = new int[10][c]; // Not legal. Only the leftmost parameter
                                      // can be variable
  //int (*cthulu)[] = new int[10][50]; // This is also illegal, the compiler is not allowed
                                       // to infer the constant length of the array.
</code></pre>Why isn't the multidimensional array here just an <code>int**</code>? Clearly if <code>int* x</code> is equivalent to <code>int x[]</code>, shouldn't <code>int** x</code> be equivalent to <code>int x[][]</code>? Well, it <em>is</em> - just look at the <code>main()</code> function, its got a multidimensional array in there that can be declared as just <code>char** argv</code>. The problem is that there are two kinds of multidimensional arrays - <strong>square</strong> and <strong>jagged</strong>. While both are accessed in identical ways, how they work is fundamentally different.</p><p>Let's look at how one would go about allocating a 3x5 square array. We can't allocate a 3x5 chunk out of our computer's memory, because memory isn't 2-dimensional, its 1-dimensional. Its just freaking huge line of bytes. Here is how you squeeze a 2-dimensional array into a 1-dimensional line:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:727px><a href=/img/tut4.png target=_blank><img src=/img/tut4.png alt="Allocating a 3x5 array" width=100%></a></div><p>As you can see, we just allocate each row right after the other to create a 15-element array ($5\cdot 3 = 15$). But then, how do we access it? Well, if it has a width of 5, to access another &ldquo;row&rdquo; we'd just skip forward by 5. In general, if we have an $n$ by $m$ multidimensional array being represented as a one-dimensional array, the proper index for a coordinate $(x,y)$ is given by: <code>array[x + (y*n)]</code>. This can be extended to 3D and beyond but it gets a little messy. This is all the compiler is really doing with multidimensional array syntax - just automating this for you.</p><p>Now, if this is a <strong>square</strong> array (as evidenced by it being a square in 2D or a cube in 3D), a jagged array is one where each array is a different size, resulting in a &ldquo;jagged&rdquo; appearance:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:320px><a href=/img/tut5.png target=_blank><img src=/img/tut5.png alt="Jagged array visualization" width=100%></a></div><p>We can't possibly allocate this in a single block of memory unless we did a lot of crazy ridiculous stuff that is totally unnecessary. However, given that arrays in C++ are just pointers to a block of memory, what if you had a pointer to a block of memory that was an array of pointers to more blocks of memory?</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:400px><a href=/img/tut6.png target=_blank><img src=/img/tut6.png alt="Jagged array pointers" width=100%></a></div><p>Suddenly we have our jagged array that can be accessed just like our previous arrays. It should be pointed out that with this format, each inner-array can be in a totally random chunk of memory, so the last element could be at position 200 and the first at position 5 billion. Consequently, pointer arithmetic only makes sense within each column. Because this is an array of arrays, we declare it by creating an array of pointers. This, however, does <strong>not</strong> initialize the entire array; all we have now is an array of <em>illegal pointers</em>. Since each array could be a different size than the other arrays (this being the entire point of having a jagged array in the first place), the only possible way of initializing these arrays is individually, often by using a <code>for loop</code>. Luckily, the syntax for accessing jagged arrays is the exact same as with square arrays.</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int** jagged = new int*[5]; //Creates an array of 5 pointers to integers.
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i)
  {
    jagged[i] = new int[3+i]; //Assigns each pointer to a new array of a unique size
  }
  jagged[4][1]=0; //Now we can assign values directly, or...
  int* second = jagged[2]; //Pull out one column, and
  second[0]=0; //manipulate it as a single array

  // The double-access works because of the order of operations. Since [] is just an
  // operator, it is evaluated from left to right, like any other operator. Here it is
  // again, but with the respective types that each operator resolves to in parenthesis.
  ( (int&amp;) ( (int*&amp;) jagged[4] ) [1] ) = 0;
}
</code></pre>As you can see above, just like we can have pointers to pointers, we can also have references to pointers, since pointers are just another data type. This allows you to re-assign pointer values inside jagged arrays, like so: <code>jagged[2] = (int*)kitty</code>. However, until <code>C++0x</code>, those references didn't have any meaningful data type, so even though the compiler was using <code>int*&</code>, using that in your code will throw a compiler error in older compilers. If you need to make your code work in non-<code>C++0x</code> compilers, you can simply avoid using references to pointers and instead use a pointer to a pointer.<pre class=language-cpp><code>int* bunny;
int* value = new int[5];

int*&amp; bunnyref = bunny; // Throws an error in old compilers
int** pbunny = &amp;bunny; // Will always work
bunnyref = value; // This does the same exact thing as below.
*pbunny = value;

// bunny is now equal to value
</code></pre>This also demonstrates the other use of a pointer-to-pointer data type, allowing you to remotely manipulate a pointer just like a pointer allows you to remotely manipulate an integer or other value type. So obviously you can do pointers to pointers to pointers to pointers to an absurd degree of lunacy, but this is <em>exceedingly rare</em> so you shouldn't need to worry about it. Now you should be strong in the art of pointer-fu, so our next tutorial will finally get into object-oriented techniques in C++ in comparison to C#. <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-3-classes-and/>Part 3: Classes and Structs and Inheritance OH MY!</a></p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-07-21T19:35:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/>July 21, 2011 at 7:35pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;7 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=C%23%20to%20C%2b%2b%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%202%3a%20Pointers%20Everywhere%21&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/radians-explanation/>Radians: An explanation</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Radians are used in almost everything that involves computers, and often come up in mathematical equations.

Doing so allows you to recognize the close parallels between both languages, and why and how they are different. This tutorial will assume you have a fairly strong grasp of C#, but may not be familiar with some of its more arcane attributes.</p><p>In C#, everything is an object, or a static member of an object. You can't have a function just floating around willy-nilly. However, like all programs, a C# program must have an entry-point. If you have primarily done GUI-based design, you probably aren't aware of the entry-point that is automatically generated, but it is definitely there, and like everything else, it's part of an object. C# actually allows you to change the entry point function, but a default C# project will automatically generate a Program.cs file that looks like this:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace ScheduleTimer
{
  static class Program
  {
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// The main entry point for the application.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    [STAThread]
    static void Main()
    {
      Application.EnableVisualStyles();
      Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(true);
      Application.Run(new frmMain());
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><code>static void Main()</code> is the real entry point for your application, which simply initializes visual styles and then immediately launches the form that most C# users are accustomed to working with. Now, we can compare this with a simple &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; C++ program:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Hello World&#34;;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>This program, to a C# user, immediately looks foreign and possibly even outright hostile. However, almost everything in it has a direct analogue in C#, despite the rather inane syntax that is being used. The most glaring example here is the insertion operator, &#171;, because almost no one ever uses it except for in streams and the fact that it's in a C++ Hello World program creates an absurd amount of confusion. It's just a fancy way of doing this:<pre class=language-cpp><code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  std::cout.write(&#34;Hello World&#34;,11);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>Now, counting the number of bytes you are pumping into the stream is really annoying, and that's what the insertion operator does for you; it properly formats everything automatically. That's all. It's not a demon from hell bent on destroying your life, its just weird syntax. I don't know why they don't also have this functionality in a much easier to understand overloaded function, but there are a lot of things that they don't do, so we'll just have to live with it.</p><p>The <code>main()</code> function here serves the same exact purpose as the <code>Main()</code> function in C#. Strict C++ requires you to have a <code>main()</code> function to serve as an entry point, but various operating systems modify it and, in the case of Windows, outright replace it. As such, you will notice that your &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; C++ program, when built, opens in a command line. You will learn later how to prevent this by using Windows&rsquo; proprietary entry function. For those of you familiar with C#, this is exactly the same as C#&lsquo;s ability to change around the entry point of the application, and you can even make a command line application in C# too by properly changing the compiler settings. The same concept applies to C++, but unlike C#, which defaults to a GUI, C++ defaults to a command line. Changing the compiler settings properly will result in a C++ program that starts in a GUI, just like C# (although unlike C#, C++ doesn't have any help, which turns GUI programming into a complete nightmare).</p><p>So now that we have a direct analogue between C# and C++ in terms of where our application <em>starts</em>, we need to deal with a conceptual difference in how C# and C++ handle <em>dependencies</em>. In C#, your class file is just <code>Class.cs</code>, your helper class is <code>Helper.cs</code>, and both of them can call the other one provided they are in the same namespace, or if you are inheriting someone else's, using the correct <code>using</code> statements to resolve the code. If these concepts are not familiar to you, you should learn more about C# before delving further into C++.</p><p>C++, on the other hand, does not do behind-the-scenes magic to help you resolve your dependencies. To understand what C++ is doing, one must understand how any compiler resolves references inside code (including C#). When the C# compiler is compiling your project, it goes through each of your code files <strong>one by one</strong> and compiles everything to an intermediate object code that will later be compiled down into the machine code (or, in this case, bytecode, since C# is an interpreted language). But wait, what if it's compiling <code>Class.cs</code> before <code>Helper.cs</code> even though <code>Class</code> instantiates a <code>Helper</code> object and calls some functions inside of it that then instantiate another <code>Class</code> object? Well, what if you compiled <code>Helper.cs</code> first&mldr; but <code>Helper.cs</code> needs <code>Class.cs</code> to be compiled first because its instantiating a <code>Class</code> object inside the function that the <code>Class</code> object is calling! That's a circular dependency! <em>THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE OH GOD WE'RE GOING TO DIE</em> No, it's actually quite simple to deal with. Enter <em>prototypes</em>. If you have the following C# class:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>using System;

namespace FunFunBunBuns
{
  class Class
  {
    private int _yay;
    private int _bunnies;

    // Constructor
    public Class(int yay)
    {
      _yay = yay;
      _bunnies = 0; // :C
    }

    // Destructor
    public ~Class()
    {
      _yay = 0;
    }

    public void IncrementYay()
    {
      _yay++;
    }
    
    public int MakeBunnies(int num) // :D
    {
      _bunnies = _bunnies + num;
      return _bunnies;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>Making &ldquo;prototypes&rdquo; of these functions (which C# doesn't have so this will be invalid syntax) would be the following:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>using System;

namespace FunFunBunBuns
{
  class Class
  {
    private int _yay;
    private int _bunnies;

    // Constructor
    public Class(int yay);
    // Destructor
    public ~Class();
    public void IncrementYay();
    public int MakeBunnies(int num);
  }
}
</code></pre>Notice the distinct lack of code - this is how circular references get resolved. It turns out that to properly compile your program, the compiler only has to know what a function takes in as arguments, and what it returns. By treating the function as a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; of sorts, the compiler can ignore whatever code is inside it. Notice that this applies to constructors and destructors as well - they are simply special functions inside the class. In this manner the entire class can be treated as a bunch of black-box functions that don't actually have any code that needs to be compiled in them. What the C# compiler does is create a bunch of these prototypes behind the scenes and feed them in front of all your code files, so it first compiles <code>Class.cs</code> using a prototype of the <code>Helper</code> class, which allows it to instantiate and use any functions that <code>Helper</code> defines without actually knowing the code inside them. Then, it compiles <code>Helper.cs</code>, compiling assigning code to the previously empty black-box functions defined in the <code>Helper</code> prototype, using a prototype of <code>Class</code> so that it can also instantiate and call functions from <code>Class</code>. In this way, both <code>Helper.cs</code> and <code>Class.cs</code> can be compiled in any order.</p><p>But wait, what if <code>Class</code> inherits <code>Helper</code>? In reality, this changes nothing. An important lesson here is that, in C++, you will not be able to simply ignore the fact that <em>everything is a function</em>. Classes are just an abstraction - in reality, inheritance, constructors, deconstructors, operators, everything is just various special functions. Python's class syntax is interesting because requires that all class functions explicitly define the <code>self</code> parameter (which is identical to the <code>this</code> reference in C++ and C#), even the class constructor. Both C++ and C# hide all this from you, so Constructors and Destructors and class functions all magically just work, even though underneath it all they're just ordinary functions with a special parameter that's hidden from view. This is, in fact, how one mimics class behavior in C, which does not have object-oriented features - simply build a struct and make a bunch of functions for it that take a &ldquo;this&rdquo; pointer, or a pointer to a specific struct on which the function operates. This behavior can be (needlessly) duplicated using C# - let's transform our <code>Class</code> class to C-style function implementations, ignoring the slightly invalid C# syntax.</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>using System;

namespace FunFunBunBuns
{
  struct Class
  {
    private int _yay;
    private int _bunnies;
  };

  public Constructor(Class this, int yay)
  {
    this._yay = yay;
    this._bunnies = 0; // :C
  }

  public Destructor(Class this)
  {
    this._yay = 0;
  }

  public void IncrementYay(Class this)
  {
    this._yay++;
  }
    
  public int MakeBunnies(Class this, int num) // :D
  {
    this._bunnies = this._bunnies + num;
    return this._bunnies;
  }
}
</code></pre>Thankfully, we don't have to worry about this, since thinking of class functions as functions that operate on the object is a lot more intuitive. However, one must be aware that even in inheritance scenarios, everything is just a function, or an overload of a virtual function, or something similar (if you do not know what virtual functions are, you need to learn more C# before proceeding). Consequently, our ability to declare function prototypes solves <em>all</em> the dependency issues, because <em>everything</em> is a function.</p><p>This is where we get into exactly what the <code>#include</code> directive is for. In C#, all your files are automatically accessible from every other file, and this isn't a problem because compilation is nigh-instantaneous. C++ is much more intensive to compile, partially because it doesn't have a precompiled 400 MB library of crap to work off of, and partially due to a much more complicated precompiler. That means in C++, if you want a given file to have access to another file, you have to <code>#include</code> that file. In our Hello World application, we are including <code>iostream</code>, which does not have a .h file extension on the end for stupid regulatory reasons. However, what about the file our code is in? Our code is not in a .h file, its in a .cpp file. This is where we get to a critical difference between C# and C++. While C# just has .cs files for code, <strong>C++ has two types of files: header files and code files</strong>.</p><code>.cpp == C++ (C-plus-plus) code file
.h = C++ Header file</code><p>Header files contain class and function prototypes, and code files contain all the actual code. A C++ project is therefore defined entirely by a list of .cpp files that need to be compiled. Header files are just little helper files that make resolving dependencies easier. C# does this for you - C++ does not. Note that because these are technically arbitrary file distinctions, you can put whatever you want in either file type; nothing will stop you from doing <code>#include "main.cpp"</code>, its just ridiculous and confusing. Both <code>#include &lt;></code> and <code>#include ""</code> are valid syntax for the <code>#include</code> directive, there is no <em>real</em> difference. Standard procedure, however, is that <code>#include &lt;></code> is used for any header files outside of your project, and <code>#include ""</code> is used for header files inside your project, or closely related to it.</p><p>So what we're doing when we say <code>#include &lt;iostream></code> is that we're including a bunch of prototypes for various input/output stream (i/o stream &ndash;> iostream) related classes defined in the standard library, which your compiler already has the corresponding .cpp implementations of built into it. So, the compiler links the application against this header file, and when you use <code>std::cout</code>, it just treats everything in it (including that ridiculously obtuse <code>&lt;&lt; operator</code>, which is really just another function) as a black-box function.</p><p>Consequently, unless you know what your doing, you should keep code out of header files. C++ doesn't prevent you from throwing functions that aren't attached to classes all over the place, like C# does, so what would happen if you defined <code>int ponies() { return 0; }</code> in a header file that you include in two seperate .cpp files? The compiler will try to compile the function twice, and on the second time it will explode because the function it tried to put code into already had code in it, since it wasn't a prototype! <strong>EVERYTHING DIES!</strong> So until you get to the more advanced areas of C++, don't put code in your header files (unless you want to watch your compiler die, you monster).</p><p>At this point I want to clarify what <code>std::</code> is, because it looks rather weird to a C# programmer. In C#, the <code>. operator</code> works on everything - you just have <code>System.Forms.Whatever.Help.Im.Trapped.In.A.Universe.Factory.Your.Class.Member.Function()</code> and its all good. In C++, that's not going to work anymore. The <code>:: operator</code> is known as the Scope Resolution Operator. It's a lot easier to explain if I first explain what the <code>. operator</code> has been demoted to. You can only use the <code>. operator</code> on a <em>reference or value type</em> of an <em>instantiated object</em> (basically everything you've ever worked with in C#). The important distinction here is that <strong>static functions cannot be accessed with the <code>. operator</code> anymore</strong>. This is because Static functions, along with namespaces and typedefs and <em>everything else</em> must use the Scope Resolution Operator. Consequently, you can think of the <code>. operator</code> as being demoted to just calling class functions, and everything else now uses the <code>:: operator</code>. So, <code>std::cout</code> just means that we're access the <code>cout</code> class in the <code>std</code> namespace.</p><p>Now we just have one more hurdle to overcome with the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application, that funky <code>char* argv[]</code> parameter in <code>main()</code>. Most C# programmers can correctly infer that it is probably an array of some sort, but we don't know what type <code>char*</code> is, other than its clearly related to <code>char</code>.</p><p><code>char*</code> is a <strong>pointer</strong>. Yes, the same scary pointers you hear about all the time. No, they aren't really scary. In fact, you have been using similar concepts in C# all the time without actually realizing it. First, however, let's take a hard look at what a pointer really is.</p><p>Everything in your entire program takes up <strong>memory</strong>. Since this tutorial is designed for people who know C# already, I really, really hope you already knew that. What you might not know is that all this memory has a specific location on the machine. In fact, on a 32-bit machine, <strong>every single possible location of a byte</strong> can be contained in <strong>an unsigned 32-bit integer</strong>. This is why we are currently moving to 64-bit CPUs, because an unsigned 32-bit integer can only hold up to 4294967295 possible byte locations, which amounts to 4.2 gigs of memory. That's why you are limited to 4 gigs of RAM on a 32-bit machine, and windows has difficulty using more than 2 gigs because a lot of older programs assumed that a <strong>signed</strong> 32-bit integer was sufficient for all memory addresses, so windows has to do some funky memory paging techniques to get programs that ignore the last bit to use memory locations above 2147483647.</p><p>So, if you allocate a float, either on the stack or on the heap, <em>it must exist somewhere within those 4294967295 possible byte locations</em>. Consequently, lets say you want to call a function that modifies that float, but the function has to have a void return value for some arbitrary reason. If you know where in memory that float is, you can tell the function where to find the float and modify it to the desired value without ever returning a value. Here is an example C++ function doing just that (which is syntactically valid all by itself because C++ allows functions outside of classes):</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void ModifyFloat(float* p)
{
  *p = 100.0;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  float x = 0; //x is equal to 0.0
  ModifyFloat( &amp;x );
  // x is now equal to 100.0
}
</code></pre>What's going on here? First, we have our <code>ModifyFloat()</code> function. This takes a pointer to a <code>float</code>, which is declared by adding a <code>*</code> to the desired type we want to make a pointer to. Remember that pointers are really just 32-bit integers (or 64-bit if you have a 64-bit operating system), but C++ assigns them a type so that if you try to assign a <code>double</code> to a pointer to a <code>float</code>, it throws an error instead of overflowing 4 extra bytes, causing a heap corruption and destroying the universe. So <code>char*</code> is a pointer to a <code>char</code>, a <code>double*</code> points to a <code>double</code>, and <code>Helper*</code> is a pointer to our own <code>Helper</code> class.</p><p>The next thing done in <code>ModifyFloat()</code> is <code>*p</code>. In this case, the <code>* operator</code> is the <em>dereference</em> operator. So unfortunately <code>*</code> is the multiply, pointer, and dereference operator in C++. Yes, this is retarded. I'm sorry. But what the heck does dereference even mean? It takes a pointer type and turns it into a <em>reference</em>. You already know what a reference is, even if you don't realize it. In C#, you can pass a variable of your <code>Helper</code> class into a function, modify the class in the function, and the original variable will get modified too! This is because, by default, classes are passed <em>by-reference</em> in C#. That means, even though it looks identical to a variable passed <em>by value</em>, any changes made to the variable are in fact made to whatever variable it references. So, this idea of passing variables in by reference should be familiar to an experienced C# programmer. C++ has references too, I just haven't gone over their syntax. Here's a more explicit version of the function:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void ModifyFloat(float* p)
{
  float&amp; ref_p = *p;
  ref_p = 100.0;
}
</code></pre>This is the exact same as the previous function, but here we can clearly see the reference. In C#, if you wanted a variable normally passed by value, like a struct, to get passed by reference, you had to override the default behavior by adding <code>ref</code>. In C++, a variable that is a reference to a given type is declared in a similar manner to a pointer. The <code>& operator</code> is used instead of <code>*</code>, so in this example, float& is a reference to a <code>float</code>. We assign it to the value produced by turning our pointer into a <code>float</code> reference. Then we just set our reference equal to 100.0 and it magically alters the original variable, just like it would in C#. In fact, here is the same function written in (slightly illegal) C#:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>public static void ModifyFloat(ref float p)
{
  p=100.0;
}
</code></pre>This does the same thing, just without the pointer. In fact, we can totally ignore the pointer in C++ too, if we want (which I tend to prefer, when possible, because its a lot easier to work with):</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void ModifyFloat(float&amp; ref_p)
{
  ref_p = 100.0;
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  float x = 0; //x is equal to 0.0
  ModifyFloat( x );
  // x is now equal to 100.0
}
</code></pre>Now, in this implementation, you will notice that our call to <code>ModifyFloat</code> is now equivalent to what it would be in C#, in that we just pass in the variable. What happened to that random <code>& operator</code> we had there before? The <code>& operator</code> is also known as the <code>address-of operator</code>, meaning when its applied to a variable as opposed to a type, it returns a pointer to that variable (yay, more context-dependent redundant operators). So, we could rewrite our function as follows to make it a bit more clear:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void ModifyFloat(float* p)
{
  float&amp; ref_p = *p; //get a reference from the pointer
  ref_p = 100.0; //modify the reference
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  float x = 0; //x is equal to 0.0
  float* p_x = &amp;x; //get a pointer to x
  ModifyFloat( p_x ); //pass pointer into function
  // x is now equal to 100.0 
}
</code></pre>As we can see, pointers are just the underlying work behind references. If you ever go into Managed C++, you'll find out that all C# references are really just pointers, but the language treats them as references so they're hidden from you. In C++, you can have both pointers and references. It is important to note that you can only <em>initialize</em> a reference variable. Any subsequent operators will be applied to whatever variable its referencing, making it impossible to get the address of a reference variable or do anything to the reference variable itself - for all intents and purposes, it just <em>is</em> the variable it references. This is why pointers are handy - you CAN reassign the actual pointer variable while also accessing the variable its pointing to. Consequently, you can also get the address of a pointer variable, since just like any other variable, including the reference variable, it must occupy memory, and therefore has a location that you can get a pointer to (we'll get to that syntax in a minute). But there's one more thing&mldr;</p><p><strong>What about arrays?</strong> In C#, arrays are actually a built-in class that has lots of fancy functions and whatnot. Interestingly, they are still of fixed size. C++ arrays are also fixed size, but they are manipulated as raw memory. Let's compare initializing an array in C++ and initializing an array in C#:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>int[] numbers = new int[5];
</code></pre><pre class=language-cpp><code>int* numbers = new int[5];
</code></pre>It should be pretty obvious at this point that <em>arrays are pointers</em> in C++. I can even rewrite the above in C++ using an empty array syntax, and it will be equally as valid:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int numbers[] = new int[5];
</code></pre><strong><code>int *x*[]</code> is identical to <code>int* *x*</code></strong>. There is no difference. Observe the following modification of our original Hello World function:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char** argv);
</code></pre>Same thing. In fact, if you watch your compiler output carefully, you might even see the compiler internally convert all the arrays to pointers when its resolving types. Now, as a C# programmer, you should already know what arrays are. You should probably also be at least dimly aware that each element of an array occupies memory directly after the element proceeding it. So, if you know where the address of the <em>first</em> element is, you know the second element is exactly <em>x</em> bytes afterwards, where <em>x</em> is the number of bytes your type takes up. This is why pointers have types associated with them - we know that <code>float*</code> points to an array of elements, and that each element takes up 4 bytes. To verify this, the <code>sizeof()</code> built-in function/operator/whatever will return the number of bytes a given type, class, or struct takes up. That's the number of bytes we skip ahead to get to the next element in an array. This is all done transparently in C++ using the same array index operator as C# uses:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  int* ponies = new int[5];
  ponies[0] = 1; //First element..
  ponies[1] = 2; //Second element...
}
</code></pre>So pointers can be treated as arrays that behave exactly the same way a C# array does. However, the astute C# programmer would ask, how do you know how long the array is?</p><p><span style=color:red><h5>YOU DON'T</h5></span>Enter every single buffer overflow error that has been the bane of man since the beginning of time. <em>YOU</em> have to keep track of how long the array is, and you'd better be damn sure you don't get it wrong. Consequently any function taking an array of variable size will also require a separate argument telling the function how many elements are in the array. Usually arrays are just constructed on the stack with a constant, known size, which is often harmless and pretty hard to screw up. If you start doing funky things with them, though, you might want to look up <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/>std::vector</a> for an encapsulated dynamic array.</p><p>So C++ arrays are just like C# arrays, except they are pointers to the first element, and you don't know how long they are (and they might cause the destruction of the universe if you screw up). You should already know that a string is an array, and consequently in C++ the standard string type is <code>const char*</code>, not <code>string</code>. You also can't put them in switch() statements. Sorry.</p><p>There's a lot of stuff about pointers that this tutorial hasn't covered, like function pointers and pointer arithmetic, which we'll get to next time.</p><p><a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/>Part 2: Pointers To Everything</a></p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-07-06T04:26:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/>July 6, 2011 at 4:26am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;16 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=C%23%20to%20C%2b%2b%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201%3a%20Basics%20of%20Syntax&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/on-hackers/>On Hacking (or Why We Need Security Ratings)</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2671612">Another website has been hacked</a>. It seems almost routine now, with site after site getting demolished by hackers. The overwhelming public response to the catastrophe has been to ask, &ldquo;can anything be made secure?&rdquo; Security experts, naturally, are constantly attacking the companies in question for their dismal security practices, but what of the general public? They don't know what a hash is. They don't know what an SQL injection is. They have no reason to know these things and will never understand them. All they understand is that their company assured them they had good security, and then they were hacked, and somehow the good security wasn't actually good. So then they'll move to another company, and this time, they're told, this company <em>really does have</em> good security. But nope, it got hacked too, guess that good security wasn't actually good.</p><p>Can any security be good? A security expert knows why the companies were hacked and can answer that question - the average Joe probably won't be able to. This is the crux of the problem - What is good security? How can an average person figure out what good security is? Good security used to be MD5 hashing. Then it was MD5 hashing with a seed. Now MD5 is cryptographically insecure, so we're trying to move to SHA1, but even that might be crackable in the near future, so someone invented bcrypt, but now the bcrypt implementation has demonstrated <a href=http://rondam.blogspot.com/2011/06/possible-flaw-in-open-source-bcrypt.html>some unnerving behavior</a>, making its implementation unverified. Then there is SQL injection vulnerabilities and the long list of <a href=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html>XSS attacks</a>, along with cookiejacking made possible by unencrypted networks and <a href=http://codebutler.com/firesheep>Firesheep</a>. Even now we are seeing weaknesses at the highest echelons of security - <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2011/06/rsa-finally-comes-clean-securid-is-compromised.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss">hacked RSA databases</a> and even <a href=http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/>HTTPS certificates</a>.</p><p>Answering our question of what good security is clearly isn't easy. Of course, what if we assume that all security is broken? We would have to outlaw all hacking and seriously punish the offenders because there is nothing that can be done to lock up the system. This approach, however, is inherently flawed. For one, it is closely related to the drug war waged by the U.S. authorities, which has been astoundingly ineffective at stopping the drug trade. Not because it can't shut down drug-rings (it's very good at doing that), but simply because the business is so profitable that for every player you kill in the game, another one crops up to take their place. Lulzsec serves as a harbinger of that scenario, where hacking is cheap, and even if you throw everyone involved in jail, someone else will replace them.</p><p>However, even this scenario is being optimistic. If security is near impossible, computers become useless. The real world would turn into Hollywood, where electronics are easily bypassed. The problem is that if computer security is easily bypassed, people will stop using it. Online transactions die. The paper trail comes back. People refuse to put their personal details in anything that could be digitized. Everything that has enabled the technological explosion of today would get stuck in a tug-of-war between security and convenience. If history is anything to go by, the public would rather give up the last bits of their privacy just so they could use all the conveniences of electronics without having to worry about hackers. Suddenly we live in 1964.</p><p>This scenario may seem implausible to you because <em>it is</em>. Computer security <strong>can be effective</strong>, it simply needs to be done properly, which is not impossible. It may be difficult, but so is starting a successful company, and that doesn't seem to stop any of <a href=http://news.ycombinator.com/>the entrepreneurs</a>. The problem we face is that the average customer has no way of discerning good security from bad security. If they could, market pressures would force companies to adapt the best security possible, or customers would take their data elsewhere. Security is crap because no one knows what security is other then the security experts.</p><p>We have building inspectors and elevator certifications and health inspectors&mldr; why not security inspectors? It doesn't need to be government mandated, considering the government's track record, it might be a lot better if a private company or group provided the service, but somehow, there needs to be a way to measure security in a verifiable manner. There are two ways I know of to do this (there may be others) - from the inside, and from the outside. An inside inspection is more reliable when done properly, but more likely to be corrupted and gamed. An outside inspection, however, doesn't rely on the consent of a company to plaster a security rating on them. The downside is that an outside inspection requires pummeling the company's product blindly, which will only catch the really stupid mistakes, and not the dangerous middle-ground between really bad security and really good security.</p><p>I'm not pretending I know how to solve this problem. I don't, but I do know that someone needs to figure this out. If we are going to make any headway with security, the general public needs a friendly, easy, intuitive way to check the security rating of a company, instead of relying on the company's insistence that it uses a &ldquo;<a href=http://securosis.com/tag/sony+breach>very sophisticated security system</a>". Only then will market pressures push for the resurgence of proper security.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-06-19T17:56:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/on-hackers/>June 19, 2011 at 5:56pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/on-hackers/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;4 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fon-hackers%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=On%20Hacking%20%28or%20Why%20We%20Need%20Security%20Ratings%29&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fon-hackers%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fon-hackers%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><div class=pager><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/20>Newer</a></li><li style=text-align:center><a href=/blog/>Home</a></li><li style=text-align:right><a href=/blog/page/22>Older</a></li></ul></div></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/age-of-bullshit/>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</a></li><li><a href=/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
