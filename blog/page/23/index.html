Doing so allows you to recognize the close parallels between both languages, and why and how they are different. This tutorial will assume you have a fairly strong grasp of C#, but may not be familiar with some of its more arcane attributes.</p><p>In C#, everything is an object, or a static member of an object. You can&rsquo;t have a function just floating around willy-nilly. However, like all programs, a C# program must have an entry-point. If you have primarily done GUI-based design, you probably aren&rsquo;t aware of the entry-point that is automatically generated, but it is definitely there, and like everything else, it&rsquo;s part of an object. C# actually allows you to change the entry point function, but a default C# project will automatically generate a Program.cs file that looks like this:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace ScheduleTimer
{
  static class Program
  {
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// The main entry point for the application.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    [STAThread]
    static void Main()
    {
      Application.EnableVisualStyles();
      Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(true);
      Application.Run(new frmMain());
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><code>static void Main()</code> is the real entry point for your application, which simply initializes visual styles and then immediately launches the form that most C# users are accustomed to working with. Now, we can compare this with a simple &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; C++ program:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Hello World&#34;;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>This program, to a C# user, immediately looks foreign and possibly even outright hostile. However, almost everything in it has a direct analogue in C#, despite the rather inane syntax that is being used. The most glaring example here is the insertion operator, &#171;, because almost no one ever uses it except for in streams and the fact that it&rsquo;s in a C++ Hello World program creates an absurd amount of confusion. It&rsquo;s just a fancy way of doing this:<pre class=language-cpp><code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  std::cout.write(&#34;Hello World&#34;,11);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>Now, counting the number of bytes you are pumping into the stream is really annoying, and that&rsquo;s what the insertion operator does for you; it properly formats everything automatically. That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s not a demon from hell bent on destroying your life, its just weird syntax. I don&rsquo;t know why they don&rsquo;t also have this functionality in a much easier to understand overloaded function, but there are a lot of things that they don&rsquo;t do, so we&rsquo;ll just have to live with it.</p><p>The <code>main()</code> function here serves the same exact purpose as the <code>Main()</code> function in C#. Strict C++ requires you to have a <code>main()</code> function to serve as an entry point, but various operating systems modify it and, in the case of Windows, outright replace it. As such, you will notice that your &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; C++ program, when built, opens in a command line. You will learn later how to prevent this by using Windows&rsquo; proprietary entry function. For those of you familiar with C#, this is exactly the same as C#&rsquo;s ability to change around the entry point of the application, and you can even make a command line application in C# too by properly changing the compiler settings. The same concept applies to C++, but unlike C#, which defaults to a GUI, C++ defaults to a command line. Changing the compiler settings properly will result in a C++ program that starts in a GUI, just like C# (although unlike C#, C++ doesn&rsquo;t have any help, which turns GUI programming into a complete nightmare).</p><p>So now that we have a direct analogue between C# and C++ in terms of where our application <em>starts</em>, we need to deal with a conceptual difference in how C# and C++ handle <em>dependencies</em>. In C#, your class file is just <code>Class.cs</code>, your helper class is <code>Helper.cs</code>, and both of them can call the other one provided they are in the same namespace, or if you are inheriting someone else&rsquo;s, using the correct <code>using</code> statements to resolve the code. If these concepts are not familiar to you, you should learn more about C# before delving further into C++.</p><p>C++, on the other hand, does not do behind-the-scenes magic to help you resolve your dependencies. To understand what C++ is doing, one must understand how any compiler resolves references inside code (including C#). When the C# compiler is compiling your project, it goes through each of your code files <strong>one by one</strong> and compiles everything to an intermediate object code that will later be compiled down into the machine code (or, in this case, bytecode, since C# is an interpreted language). But wait, what if it&rsquo;s compiling <code>Class.cs</code> before <code>Helper.cs</code> even though <code>Class</code> instantiates a <code>Helper</code> object and calls some functions inside of it that then instantiate another <code>Class</code> object? Well, what if you compiled <code>Helper.cs</code> first&mldr; but <code>Helper.cs</code> needs <code>Class.cs</code> to be compiled first because its instantiating a <code>Class</code> object inside the function that the <code>Class</code> object is calling! That&rsquo;s a circular dependency! <em><del>THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE OH GOD WE&rsquo;RE GOING TO DIE</del></em> No, it&rsquo;s actually quite simple to deal with. Enter <em>prototypes</em>. If you have the following C# class:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>using System;

namespace FunFunBunBuns
{
  class Class
  {
    private int _yay;
    private int _bunnies;

    // Constructor
    public Class(int yay)
    {
      _yay = yay;
      _bunnies = 0; // :C
    }

    // Destructor
    public ~Class()
    {
      _yay = 0;
    }

    public void IncrementYay()
    {
      _yay++;
    }
    
    public int MakeBunnies(int num) // :D
    {
      _bunnies = _bunnies + num;
      return _bunnies;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>Making &ldquo;prototypes&rdquo; of these functions (which C# doesn&rsquo;t have so this will be invalid syntax) would be the following:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>using System;

namespace FunFunBunBuns
{
  class Class
  {
    private int _yay;
    private int _bunnies;

    // Constructor
    public Class(int yay);
    // Destructor
    public ~Class();
    public void IncrementYay();
    public int MakeBunnies(int num);
  }
}
</code></pre>Notice the distinct lack of code - this is how circular references get resolved. It turns out that to properly compile your program, the compiler only has to know what a function takes in as arguments, and what it returns. By treating the function as a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; of sorts, the compiler can ignore whatever code is inside it. Notice that this applies to constructors and destructors as well - they are simply special functions inside the class. In this manner the entire class can be treated as a bunch of black-box functions that don&rsquo;t actually have any code that needs to be compiled in them. What the C# compiler does is create a bunch of these prototypes behind the scenes and feed them in front of all your code files, so it first compiles <code>Class.cs</code> using a prototype of the <code>Helper</code> class, which allows it to instantiate and use any functions that <code>Helper</code> defines without actually knowing the code inside them. Then, it compiles <code>Helper.cs</code>, compiling assigning code to the previously empty black-box functions defined in the <code>Helper</code> prototype, using a prototype of <code>Class</code> so that it can also instantiate and call functions from <code>Class</code>. In this way, both <code>Helper.cs</code> and <code>Class.cs</code> can be compiled in any order.</p><p>But wait, what if <code>Class</code> inherits <code>Helper</code>? In reality, this changes nothing. An important lesson here is that, in C++, you will not be able to simply ignore the fact that <em>everything is a function</em>. Classes are just an abstraction - in reality, inheritance, constructors, deconstructors, operators, everything is just various special functions. Python&rsquo;s class syntax is interesting because requires that all class functions explicitly define the <code>self</code> parameter (which is identical to the <code>this</code> reference in C++ and C#), even the class constructor. Both C++ and C# hide all this from you, so Constructors and Destructors and class functions all magically just work, even though underneath it all they&rsquo;re just ordinary functions with a special parameter that&rsquo;s hidden from view. This is, in fact, how one mimics class behavior in C, which does not have object-oriented features - simply build a struct and make a bunch of functions for it that take a &ldquo;this&rdquo; pointer, or a pointer to a specific struct on which the function operates. This behavior can be (needlessly) duplicated using C# - let&rsquo;s transform our <code>Class</code> class to C-style function implementations, ignoring the slightly invalid C# syntax.</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>using System;

namespace FunFunBunBuns
{
  struct Class
  {
    private int _yay;
    private int _bunnies;
  };

  public Constructor(Class this, int yay)
  {
    this._yay = yay;
    this._bunnies = 0; // :C
  }

  public Destructor(Class this)
  {
    this._yay = 0;
  }

  public void IncrementYay(Class this)
  {
    this._yay++;
  }
    
  public int MakeBunnies(Class this, int num) // :D
  {
    this._bunnies = this._bunnies + num;
    return this._bunnies;
  }
}
</code></pre>Thankfully, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about this, since thinking of class functions as functions that operate on the object is a lot more intuitive. However, one must be aware that even in inheritance scenarios, everything is just a function, or an overload of a virtual function, or something similar (if you do not know what virtual functions are, you need to learn more C# before proceeding). Consequently, our ability to declare function prototypes solves <em>all</em> the dependency issues, because <em>everything</em> is a function.</p><p>This is where we get into exactly what the <code>#include</code> directive is for. In C#, all your files are automatically accessible from every other file, and this isn&rsquo;t a problem because compilation is nigh-instantaneous. C++ is much more intensive to compile, partially because it doesn&rsquo;t have a precompiled 400 MB library of crap to work off of, and partially due to a much more complicated precompiler. That means in C++, if you want a given file to have access to another file, you have to <code>#include</code> that file. In our Hello World application, we are including <code>iostream</code>, which does not have a .h file extension on the end for stupid regulatory reasons. However, what about the file our code is in? Our code is not in a .h file, its in a .cpp file. This is where we get to a critical difference between C# and C++. While C# just has .cs files for code, <strong>C++ has two types of files: header files and code files</strong>.</p><code>.cpp == C++ (C-plus-plus) code file
.h = C++ Header file</code><p>Header files contain class and function prototypes, and code files contain all the actual code. A C++ project is therefore defined entirely by a list of .cpp files that need to be compiled. Header files are just little helper files that make resolving dependencies easier. C# does this for you - C++ does not. Note that because these are technically arbitrary file distinctions, you can put whatever you want in either file type; nothing will stop you from doing <code>#include "main.cpp"</code>, its just ridiculous and confusing. Both <code>#include &lt;></code> and <code>#include ""</code> are valid syntax for the <code>#include</code> directive, there is no <em>real</em> difference. Standard procedure, however, is that <code>#include &lt;></code> is used for any header files outside of your project, and <code>#include ""</code> is used for header files inside your project, or closely related to it.</p><p>So what we&rsquo;re doing when we say <code>#include &lt;iostream></code> is that we&rsquo;re including a bunch of prototypes for various input/output stream (i/o stream &ndash;> iostream) related classes defined in the standard library, which your compiler already has the corresponding .cpp implementations of built into it. So, the compiler links the application against this header file, and when you use <code>std::cout</code>, it just treats everything in it (including that ridiculously obtuse <code>&lt;&lt; operator</code>, which is really just another function) as a black-box function.</p><p><a id=header-code>Consequently</a>, unless you know what your doing, you should keep code out of header files. C++ doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from throwing functions that aren&rsquo;t attached to classes all over the place, like C# does, so what would happen if you defined <code>int ponies() { return 0; }</code> in a header file that you include in two seperate .cpp files? The compiler will try to compile the function twice, and on the second time it will explode because the function it tried to put code into already had code in it, since it wasn&rsquo;t a prototype! <strong>EVERYTHING DIES!</strong> So until you get to the more advanced areas of C++, don&rsquo;t put code in your header files (unless you want to watch your compiler die, you monster).</p><p>At this point I want to clarify what <code>std::</code> is, because it looks rather weird to a C# programmer. In C#, the <code>. operator</code> works on everything - you just have <code>System.Forms.Whatever.Help.Im.Trapped.In.A.Universe.Factory.Your.Class.Member.Function()</code> and its all good. In C++, that&rsquo;s not going to work anymore. The <code>:: operator</code> is known as the Scope Resolution Operator. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to explain if I first explain what the <code>. operator</code> has been demoted to. You can only use the <code>. operator</code> on a <em>reference or value type</em> of an <em>instantiated object</em> (basically everything you&rsquo;ve ever worked with in C#). The important distinction here is that <strong>static functions cannot be accessed with the <code>. operator</code> anymore</strong>. This is because Static functions, along with namespaces and typedefs and <em>everything else</em> must use the Scope Resolution Operator. Consequently, you can think of the <code>. operator</code> as being demoted to just calling class functions, and everything else now uses the <code>:: operator</code>. So, <code>std::cout</code> just means that we&rsquo;re access the <code>cout</code> class in the <code>std</code> namespace.</p><p>Now we just have one more hurdle to overcome with the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application, that funky <code>char* argv[]</code> parameter in <code>main()</code>. Most C# programmers can correctly infer that it is probably an array of some sort, but we don&rsquo;t know what type <code>char*</code> is, other than its clearly related to <code>char</code>.</p><p><code>char*</code> is a <strong>pointer</strong>. Yes, the same scary pointers you hear about all the time. No, they aren&rsquo;t really scary. In fact, you have been using similar concepts in C# all the time without actually realizing it. First, however, let&rsquo;s take a hard look at what a pointer really is.</p><p>Everything in your entire program takes up <strong>memory</strong>. Since this tutorial is designed for people who know C# already, I really, really hope you already knew that. What you might not know is that all this memory has a specific location on the machine. In fact, on a 32-bit machine, <strong>every single possible location of a byte</strong> can be contained in <strong>an unsigned 32-bit integer</strong>. This is why we are currently moving to 64-bit CPUs, because an unsigned 32-bit integer can only hold up to 4294967295 possible byte locations, which amounts to 4.2 gigs of memory. That&rsquo;s why you are limited to 4 gigs of RAM on a 32-bit machine, and windows has difficulty using more than 2 gigs because a lot of older programs assumed that a <strong>signed</strong> 32-bit integer was sufficient for all memory addresses, so windows has to do some funky memory paging techniques to get programs that ignore the last bit to use memory locations above 2147483647.</p><p>So, if you allocate a float, either on the stack or on the heap, <em>it must exist somewhere within those 4294967295 possible byte locations</em>. Consequently, lets say you want to call a function that modifies that float, but the function has to have a void return value for some arbitrary reason. If you know where in memory that float is, you can tell the function where to find the float and modify it to the desired value without ever returning a value. Here is an example C++ function doing just that (which is syntactically valid all by itself because C++ allows functions outside of classes):</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void ModifyFloat(float* p)
{
  *p = 100.0;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  float x = 0; //x is equal to 0.0
  ModifyFloat( &amp;x );
  // x is now equal to 100.0
}
</code></pre>What&rsquo;s going on here? First, we have our <code>ModifyFloat()</code> function. This takes a pointer to a <code>float</code>, which is declared by adding a <code>*</code> to the desired type we want to make a pointer to. Remember that pointers are really just 32-bit integers (or 64-bit if you have a 64-bit operating system), but C++ assigns them a type so that if you try to assign a <code>double</code> to a pointer to a <code>float</code>, it throws an error instead of overflowing 4 extra bytes, causing a heap corruption and destroying the universe. So <code>char*</code> is a pointer to a <code>char</code>, a <code>double*</code> points to a <code>double</code>, and <code>Helper*</code> is a pointer to our own <code>Helper</code> class.</p><p>The next thing done in <code>ModifyFloat()</code> is <code>*p</code>. In this case, the <code>* operator</code> is the <em>dereference</em> operator. So unfortunately <code>*</code> is the multiply, pointer, and dereference operator in C++. Yes, this is retarded. I&rsquo;m sorry. But what the heck does dereference even mean? It takes a pointer type and turns it into a <em>reference</em>. You already know what a reference is, even if you don&rsquo;t realize it. In C#, you can pass a variable of your <code>Helper</code> class into a function, modify the class in the function, and the original variable will get modified too! This is because, by default, classes are passed <em>by-reference</em> in C#. That means, even though it looks identical to a variable passed <em>by value</em>, any changes made to the variable are in fact made to whatever variable it references. So, this idea of passing variables in by reference should be familiar to an experienced C# programmer. C++ has references too, I just haven&rsquo;t gone over their syntax. Here&rsquo;s a more explicit version of the function:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void ModifyFloat(float* p)
{
  float&amp; ref_p = *p;
  ref_p = 100.0;
}
</code></pre>This is the exact same as the previous function, but here we can clearly see the reference. In C#, if you wanted a variable normally passed by value, like a struct, to get passed by reference, you had to override the default behavior by adding <code>ref</code>. In C++, a variable that is a reference to a given type is declared in a similar manner to a pointer. The <code>& operator</code> is used instead of <code>*</code>, so in this example, float& is a reference to a <code>float</code>. We assign it to the value produced by turning our pointer into a <code>float</code> reference. Then we just set our reference equal to 100.0 and it magically alters the original variable, just like it would in C#. In fact, here is the same function written in (slightly illegal) C#:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>public static void ModifyFloat(ref float p)
{
  p=100.0;
}
</code></pre>This does the same thing, just without the pointer. In fact, we can totally ignore the pointer in C++ too, if we want (which I tend to prefer, when possible, because its a lot easier to work with):</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void ModifyFloat(float&amp; ref_p)
{
  ref_p = 100.0;
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  float x = 0; //x is equal to 0.0
  ModifyFloat( x );
  // x is now equal to 100.0
}
</code></pre>Now, in this implementation, you will notice that our call to <code>ModifyFloat</code> is now equivalent to what it would be in C#, in that we just pass in the variable. What happened to that random <code>& operator</code> we had there before? The <code>& operator</code> is also known as the <code>address-of operator</code>, meaning when its applied to a variable as opposed to a type, it returns a pointer to that variable (yay, more context-dependent redundant operators). So, we could rewrite our function as follows to make it a bit more clear:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>void ModifyFloat(float* p)
{
  float&amp; ref_p = *p; //get a reference from the pointer
  ref_p = 100.0; //modify the reference
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  float x = 0; //x is equal to 0.0
  float* p_x = &amp;x; //get a pointer to x
  ModifyFloat( p_x ); //pass pointer into function
  // x is now equal to 100.0 
}
</code></pre>As we can see, pointers are just the underlying work behind references. If you ever go into Managed C++, you&rsquo;ll find out that all C# references are really just pointers, but the language treats them as references so they&rsquo;re hidden from you. In C++, you can have both pointers and references. It is important to note that you can only <em>initialize</em> a reference variable. Any subsequent operators will be applied to whatever variable its referencing, making it impossible to get the address of a reference variable or do anything to the reference variable itself - for all intents and purposes, it just <em>is</em> the variable it references. This is why pointers are handy - you CAN reassign the actual pointer variable while also accessing the variable its pointing to. Consequently, you can also get the address of a pointer variable, since just like any other variable, including the reference variable, it must occupy memory, and therefore has a location that you can get a pointer to (we&rsquo;ll get to that syntax in a minute). But there&rsquo;s one more thing&mldr;</p><p><strong>What about arrays?</strong> In C#, arrays are actually a built-in class that has lots of fancy functions and whatnot. Interestingly, they are still of fixed size. C++ arrays are also fixed size, but they are manipulated as raw memory. Let&rsquo;s compare initializing an array in C++ and initializing an array in C#:</p><p><pre class=language-csharp><code>int[] numbers = new int[5];
</code></pre><pre class=language-cpp><code>int* numbers = new int[5];
</code></pre>It should be pretty obvious at this point that <em>arrays are pointers</em> in C++. I can even rewrite the above in C++ using an empty array syntax, and it will be equally as valid:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int numbers[] = new int[5];
</code></pre><strong><code>int *x*[]</code> is identical to <code>int* *x*</code></strong>. There is no difference. Observe the following modification of our original Hello World function:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char** argv);
</code></pre>Same thing. In fact, if you watch your compiler output carefully, you might even see the compiler internally convert all the arrays to pointers when its resolving types. Now, as a C# programmer, you should already know what arrays are. You should probably also be at least dimly aware that each element of an array occupies memory directly after the element proceeding it. So, if you know where the address of the <em>first</em> element is, you know the second element is exactly <em>x</em> bytes afterwards, where <em>x</em> is the number of bytes your type takes up. This is why pointers have types associated with them - we know that <code>float*</code> points to an array of elements, and that each element takes up 4 bytes. To verify this, the <code>sizeof()</code> built-in function/operator/whatever will return the number of bytes a given type, class, or struct takes up. That&rsquo;s the number of bytes we skip ahead to get to the next element in an array. This is all done transparently in C++ using the same array index operator as C# uses:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int main(int argc, char** argv)

</code></pre>So pointers can be treated as arrays that behave exactly the same way a C# array does. However, the astute C# programmer would ask, how do you know how long the array is?</p><p><span style=color:red><h5>YOU DON'T</h5></span>Enter every single buffer overflow error that has been the bane of man since the beginning of time. <em>YOU</em> have to keep track of how long the array is, and you&rsquo;d better be damn sure you don&rsquo;t get it wrong. Consequently any function taking an array of variable size will also require a separate argument telling the function how many elements are in the array. Usually arrays are just constructed on the stack with a constant, known size, which is often harmless and pretty hard to screw up. If you start doing funky things with them, though, you might want to look up <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/>std::vector</a> for an encapsulated dynamic array.</p><p>So C++ arrays are just like C# arrays, except they are pointers to the first element, and you don&rsquo;t know how long they are (and they might cause the destruction of the universe if you screw up). You should already know that a string is an array, and consequently in C++ the standard string type is <code>const char*</code>, not <code>string</code>. You also can&rsquo;t put them in switch() statements. Sorry.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff about pointers that this tutorial hasn&rsquo;t covered, like function pointers and pointer arithmetic, which we&rsquo;ll get to next time.</p><p><a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/>Part 2: Pointers To Everything</a></p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-07-06T04:26:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/>July 6, 2011 at 4:26am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;16 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=C%23%20to%20C%2b%2b%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201%3a%20Basics%20of%20Syntax&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fc-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/on-hackers/>On Hacking (or Why We Need Security Ratings)</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2671612">Another website has been hacked</a>. It seems almost routine now, with site after site getting demolished by hackers. The overwhelming public response to the catastrophe has been to ask, &ldquo;can anything be made secure?&rdquo; Security experts, naturally, are constantly attacking the companies in question for their dismal security practices, but what of the general public? They don&rsquo;t know what a hash is. They don&rsquo;t know what an SQL injection is. They have no reason to know these things and will never understand them. All they understand is that their company assured them they had good security, and then they were hacked, and somehow the good security wasn&rsquo;t actually good. So then they&rsquo;ll move to another company, and this time, they&rsquo;re told, this company <em>really does have</em> good security. But nope, it got hacked too, guess that good security wasn&rsquo;t actually good.</p><p>Can any security be good? A security expert knows why the companies were hacked and can answer that question - the average Joe probably won&rsquo;t be able to. This is the crux of the problem - What is good security? How can an average person figure out what good security is? Good security used to be MD5 hashing. Then it was MD5 hashing with a seed. Now MD5 is cryptographically insecure, so we&rsquo;re trying to move to SHA1, but even that might be crackable in the near future, so someone invented bcrypt, but now the bcrypt implementation has demonstrated <a href=http://rondam.blogspot.com/2011/06/possible-flaw-in-open-source-bcrypt.html>some unnerving behavior</a>, making its implementation unverified. Then there is SQL injection vulnerabilities and the long list of <a href=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html>XSS attacks</a>, along with cookiejacking made possible by unencrypted networks and <a href=http://codebutler.com/firesheep>Firesheep</a>. Even now we are seeing weaknesses at the highest echelons of security - <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2011/06/rsa-finally-comes-clean-securid-is-compromised.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss">hacked RSA databases</a> and even <a href=http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/>HTTPS certificates</a>.</p><p>Answering our question of what good security is clearly isn&rsquo;t easy. Of course, what if we assume that all security is broken? We would have to outlaw all hacking and seriously punish the offenders because there is nothing that can be done to lock up the system. This approach, however, is inherently flawed. For one, it is closely related to the drug war waged by the U.S. authorities, which has been astoundingly ineffective at stopping the drug trade. Not because it can&rsquo;t shut down drug-rings (it&rsquo;s very good at doing that), but simply because the business is so profitable that for every player you kill in the game, another one crops up to take their place. Lulzsec serves as a harbinger of that scenario, where hacking is cheap, and even if you throw everyone involved in jail, someone else will replace them.</p><p>However, even this scenario is being optimistic. If security is near impossible, computers become useless. The real world would turn into Hollywood, where electronics are easily bypassed. The problem is that if computer security is easily bypassed, people will stop using it. Online transactions die. The paper trail comes back. People refuse to put their personal details in anything that could be digitized. Everything that has enabled the technological explosion of today would get stuck in a tug-of-war between security and convenience. If history is anything to go by, the public would rather give up the last bits of their privacy just so they could use all the conveniences of electronics without having to worry about hackers. Suddenly we live in 1964.</p><p>This scenario may seem implausible to you because <em>it is</em>. Computer security <strong>can be effective</strong>, it simply needs to be done properly, which is not impossible. It may be difficult, but so is starting a successful company, and that doesn&rsquo;t seem to stop any of <a href=http://news.ycombinator.com/>the entrepreneurs</a>. The problem we face is that the average customer has no way of discerning good security from bad security. If they could, market pressures would force companies to adapt the best security possible, or customers would take their data elsewhere. Security is crap because no one knows what security is other then the security experts.</p><p>We have building inspectors and elevator certifications and health inspectors&mldr; why not security inspectors? It doesn&rsquo;t need to be government mandated, considering the government&rsquo;s track record, it might be a lot better if a private company or group provided the service, but somehow, there needs to be a way to measure security in a verifiable manner. There are two ways I know of to do this (there may be others) - from the inside, and from the outside. An inside inspection is more reliable when done properly, but more likely to be corrupted and gamed. An outside inspection, however, doesn&rsquo;t rely on the consent of a company to plaster a security rating on them. The downside is that an outside inspection requires pummeling the company&rsquo;s product blindly, which will only catch the really stupid mistakes, and not the dangerous middle-ground between really bad security and really good security.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not pretending I know how to solve this problem. I don&rsquo;t, but I do know that someone needs to figure this out. If we are going to make any headway with security, the general public needs a friendly, easy, intuitive way to check the security rating of a company, instead of relying on the company&rsquo;s insistence that it uses a &ldquo;<a href=http://securosis.com/tag/sony+breach>very sophisticated security system</a>&rdquo;. Only then will market pressures push for the resurgence of proper security.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-06-19T17:56:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/on-hackers/>June 19, 2011 at 5:56pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/on-hackers/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;4 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fon-hackers%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=On%20Hacking%20%28or%20Why%20We%20Need%20Security%20Ratings%29&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fon-hackers%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fon-hackers%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/my-mom-had-heart-attack/>My Mom Had a Heart Attack</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>She is fine and will make a full recovery.</p><p>About 3 weeks ago, on Thursday, May 19<sup>th</sup>, at approximately 6 PM, my mom went into ventricular fibrillation and collapsed while walking on a nearby trail. She was found by two walkers who called 911 and initiated CPR. After almost a half hour of CPR and 3 defibrillator attempts, she was stabilized and taken to the nearby hospital. She had no identification, so we didn&rsquo;t know about it until after 2 hours of failed searching, at which point my dad called the local hospital.</p><p>As I was taken to see her while in critical condition, we didn&rsquo;t know if she was going to survive, or if she did, if she would have serious brain damage. A lot of things went through my mind on that car ride, but the one that was the most striking was when I realized that my inability to achieve what I had been trying to do for so long could potentially mean the last thing my mom was mentally capable of processing would be a son who had simply tried to accomplish something. Who had tried very hard, but hadn&rsquo;t actually managed to <strong>do</strong> anything of significance. My life was simply a lot of determination, a lot of talk, a lot of failures, and no results. I was still in college, I still didn&rsquo;t have a company, I didn&rsquo;t even have a job, and I still hadn&rsquo;t brought any of my more spectacular ideas to fruition. I was almost 21 years old, my mom had almost died from a heart attack, and I hadn&rsquo;t actually <em>done</em> anything.</p><p>The next day my dad called &ldquo;just about everyone&rdquo; to tell them what was going on, which indirectly resulted in me being reunited with one of my old friends. Due to my mom&rsquo;s condition in the ICU, she had little to no short term memory, and so every day when I went to visit her I would tell her that my best friend from forever ago had visited, and every day (once the breathing tube was removed), she would react with surprise. She was very confused and kept asking about why she was in the hospital. It turns out this was a pretty good question.</p><p>They did a CT scan of her chest to see if she had any blockages or other potential threats to her heart, and discovered that her arteries were entirely devoid of plaque buildup, and she appeared to be almost perfect health, aside from the fact that her heart suddenly stopped working for what appeared to be no reason at all. The only connection we could find was that a similar event happened to my grandfather (her father) at almost the same age. While he also passed out, his episode was caused by atrial fibrillation. She has since had a miniature pacemaker of sorts installed that will automatically deliver a defibrillator shock if the event ever occurs again, but it raises questions about whether the condition is hereditary.</p><p>If this is some kind of strange genetic disorder, it carries the <em>lovely</em> news that even if I&rsquo;m in perfect health in 30 years, my heart could get a random bad signal from my brain for absolutely no reason at all and I could keel over and die if no one happens to notice me pass out. Luckily I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that until I have kids in elementary school.</p><p>Thankfully my mom is back home and, aside from some minor lingering medications and precautions, has fully recovered. Unfortunately, I still haven&rsquo;t done anything.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-06-08T01:09:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/my-mom-had-heart-attack/>June 8, 2011 at 1:09am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/my-mom-had-heart-attack/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmy-mom-had-heart-attack%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=My%20Mom%20Had%20a%20Heart%20Attack&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmy-mom-had-heart-attack%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmy-mom-had-heart-attack%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/religion-problem-perspectives/>The Religion Problem: Perspectives</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>I view religion as a symptom of humanity&rsquo;s inability to operate as a rational agent. This statement will usually validate itself by being misinterpreted as an attack on religion, despite the statement itself simply stating that religion is irrational, not that it is a bad thing. Furthermore, we don&rsquo;t know if irrationality is inherently bad or worse than rationality, although humanity in general seems to prefer thinking of itself as rational despite repeatedly acting in completely irrational ways, usually <a href=http://www.cracked.com/article_18847_6-things-you-wont-believe-can-brainwash-you-election-day.html>without knowing it</a>.</p><p>Almost everyone nowadays has grown up with the advice that everyone is special. Most kids figured out around junior high that if everyone is special, no one is special, and some get all depressed over it (like I did). This is logically inconsistent if one examines people in terms of their unique perspectives. Every person on earth has a wholly unique outlook on life, and this is why a crowd of people will often have at least one person who can quickly and intuitively answer a question that stumps the rest of them. Their unique perspective allows them to arrive at a conclusion much faster and more accurately than the others, and so it is this perspective that makes everyone unique. This is also why perspectives are <em>valuable</em>: the more diverse a collection of perspectives, the more likely that one of them will figure out the solution to a given problem. This is especially important to society at large, because society by definition must confront an endless stream of problems from every imaginable background, including some backgrounds we don&rsquo;t have names for yet.</p><p>The value of unique perspectives is exemplified by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcL7H2jSk9Q&amp;feature=related">the Geth</a>, a fictional race in the world of Mass Effect. Even though they were willing to destroy the Heretics for choosing a path that made it impossible for co-existence, they were reluctant to simply rewrite them so they would see their point of view because this resulted in a loss of perspective. In addition, the Geth opposed using borrowed technology because it would blind them to alternative paths. These different perspectives and possible solutions are what the Geth see as valuable. Even a perspective that is clearly wrong could potentially be valuable - the only time a perspective&rsquo;s destruction can be justified is if the perspective calls for the destruction of other perspectives, which makes it incompatible with society.</p><p>On the other hand, teenage hormones also kick in during Junior High, solidifying the desire to fit in with other people, which is in direct conflict with the desire to be different and unique. The end result is that humans tend to fit in with certain social groups, and try to be different from others. These social groups meld perspectives together, so that the general result is that each social group will have its own general perspective on life that it strives to keep different from other social groups, where individual perspectives tend to meld themselves to be closer to the group. While the potential loss of unique perspectives is unfortunate, as long as there are many social groups, the end result is a diverse population of perspectives in society.</p><p>Religions, however, attempt to enforce very similar &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; of perspective, which can grow very large. Monotheism, usually in the form of Christianity, is extremely common in the western world, and is so common in the United States that it has created an enormous bubble of very similar perspectives. To apply the laws of economics to the situation, Christianity is a monopoly on the capitalism of perspectives. Whereas the ideal scenario is a lot of small bubbles of perspectives &ldquo;competing&rdquo; with each other, a monopoly makes it much more difficult for smaller, radically different perspectives to gain hold, and actively attempts to make itself larger in any way possible. Just as a monopoly is considered a serious problem in a capitalistic economy, so is a religious monopoly on perspectives.</p><p>Some more tolerant views of religion hold that an individual should be free to worship God in whatever way they wish, so long as they are worshiping God. This has two problems, the first being that it often excludes polytheistic religions, but primarily because it always excludes atheism. Theists who believe that atheists are to be tolerated, but would prefer that they didn&rsquo;t exist, are eliminating a perspective.</p><p>Consequently, atheists who simply tolerate religion are also eliminating a perspective. The simple fact is that both atheism and theism should always coexist so long as they are compatible with society and other perspectives. This means that the only <em>rational</em> opinion that one can have for religion is that it should be maintained as an entirely personal <em>choice of perspective</em>, and consequently valued as such. Of course, rationality itself is a perspective, so it would be more accurate to say that this is the only possible perspective that does not eliminate other perspectives (unless you can prove that one of the perspectives is sufficiently detrimental to society as a whole). The most valid perspectives, in general, are ones that tolerate other perspectives. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(film)>Contact</a> is on of my favorite movies, and it does a superb job of illustrating how both science and religion must coexist, and that it would be difficult for either to exist without the other. Science gives us technology, and religion gives us the faith that drives us to believe in potential discoveries before we have any actual evidence to believe them.</p><p>Differences in opinions are not problems, they are the manifestations of our unique perspective that make everyone valuable to society. Provided, of course, you aren&rsquo;t screaming &ldquo;DEATH TO THE INFIDELS&rdquo;, because then you are trying to eliminate someone else&rsquo;s perspective to the detriment of society. Because of this delicate balance between perspectives, it is up to society to decide which perspectives are too much of a danger to others. In doing so, however, we must always remember that Islam is not a single perspective, it is <strong><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam>1.5 billion</a></strong> perspectives.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-05-27T06:06:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/religion-problem-perspectives/>May 27, 2011 at 6:06am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/religion-problem-perspectives/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2freligion-problem-perspectives%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Religion%20Problem%3a%20Perspectives&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2freligion-problem-perspectives%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2freligion-problem-perspectives%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/ninth-circle-of-bugs/>The Ninth Circle of Bugs</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>So I&rsquo;m rewriting my <a href=www.blackspherestudios.com/storage/McClure_Erik_Regional_KD_Trees.pdf>2D culling kd-tree</a> for my graphics engine, and a strange bug pops up. On release mode, one of the images vanished. Since it didn&rsquo;t happen in debug mode, it was already a <code>heisenbug</code>. A <code>heisenbug</code> is defined as a bug that vanishes when you try to find it. It took me almost a day to trace the bug to the <code>rebalance</code> function. At first I thought the image had simply been removed from a node accidentally, but this wasn&rsquo;t the case. It took another day to finally figure out that the <code>numimages</code> variable was getting set to 0, thus causing the node to think it was empty and resulted in it deleting itself and removing itself from the tree (which caused all sorts of other problems).</p><p>Unfortunately, I could not verify the tree. Any attempt that so much as <em>touched</em> the tree&rsquo;s memory would wipe out the bug, or so I thought. Then I tried adding the verification function into an if statement that would only activate if the bug appeared - it did not. The act of adding a line of code <em>that was never executed</em> actually <strong>caused the bug to vanish</strong>.</p><p>I was absolutely stunned. This was completely insane. Following the advice of a friend, I was forced to assume the compiler somehow screwed something up, so I randomly disabled various optimizations in release mode. It turned out that disabling the <code>Omit Frame Pointers</code> optimization removed the bug. I didn&rsquo;t actually know what frame pointers <em>were</em>, only that I had turned on this optimization in many other projects for the hell of it and it had never caused any problems (no optimizations ever should, for that matter). What I discovered <a href="http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=91">was astonishing</a>. Frame pointers couldn&rsquo;t be omitted from a function if it got too complicated or needed to unwind the stack due to a possible exception. On a hunch, instead of adding the verification function to the chunk of code that was only executed if the error occurred, I instead added a vestigial <code>'throw "derp";'</code> line.</p><p><em>The problem vanished</em>.</p><p>I knew instantly that either the problem was caused by the omission of frame pointers, which would indicate a bug in the VC++ 2010 compiler (unlikely), or when the frame pointers were included, it masked the bug (much more likely). But I also had another piece of knowledge at my disposal - exactly how I could modify the function without masking the bug. I considered decompiling the function and forcing VC++ to use the flawed assembly, but that didn&rsquo;t allow me to modify the assembly in any meaningful way. A bit more experimentation revealed that any access of the root node, or for that matter, the <code>'this'</code> pointer itself (unless it was for calling a function) caused the inclusion of the frame pointer. I realized that a global variable would be exempt from this, and that I might be able to get by this limitation by assigning the address of whatever variable I needed to the global variable and passing that into the function instead.</p><p>This approach, however, failed. In fact most attempts to get around the frame pointer inclusion failed. I did, however, notice what appeared to be a separate bug in another part of the tree. A short investigation later revealed an unrelated bug in the tree caused by the solve function. However, what was causing this bug (duplicated parentC pointers) still threw up errors after solving the first bug, indicating that it was possible this mysterious insane compiler induced bug was just a symptom of a deeper one that would be easier to detect. After more hunting, a second unrelated bug was found. Clearly this tree was not nearly as stable as I had thought it was.</p><p>A third bug was eventually found, and I discovered the root cause of this bug to be an #NaN float value in the tree. This should never ever, ever happen, because it destabilizes the tree, but sure enough, I finally found the cause.</p><code>_totalremove(node->total,(const float (&)[4])currect);</code><p>Casting from a float* that was previous cast from a float[4] causes read errors at totally random times, despite this being completely valid under the circumstances. My only guess is that the compiler somehow interpreted this cast as undefined behavior and went crazy. I will never know. All I know is that I should never, ever, ever, ever, ever cast to that data type ever again, because guess what? After removing all my debug equipement and putting the cast back in, I was able to reliable reproduce the bug that started this whole mess, and removing the cast made the bug vanish.</p><p>This entire week long trek through hell was because the compiler fucked up on a goddamn <em>variable cast</em>. It wasn&rsquo;t a memory leak, it wasn&rsquo;t a buffer overrun, it was just a goddamn <em>miscast variable</em>.</p><p>Lesson: Re-validate every inch of your data structure the instant you realize you have a heisenbug, and make sure your validation function properly checks for all things that can screw things up.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-05-15T04:43:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ninth-circle-of-bugs/>May 15, 2011 at 4:43am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/ninth-circle-of-bugs/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fninth-circle-of-bugs%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Ninth%20Circle%20of%20Bugs&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fninth-circle-of-bugs%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fninth-circle-of-bugs%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><div class=pager><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/22>Newer</a></li><li style=text-align:center><a href=/blog/>Home</a></li><li style=text-align:right><a href=/blog/page/24>Older</a></li></ul></div></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2024</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/dumb-people-will-shoot-me-all-the-same/>Dumb People Will Shoot Me All The Same</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rust-async-makes-me-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out/>Rust Async Makes Me Want To Gouge My Eyes Out</a></li><li><a href=/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/>Engineers Only Get Paid If Something Is Broken</a></li><li><a href=/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/>Measuring Competence Is Epistemic Hell</a></li><li><a href=/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/>We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/>People Can't Care About Everything</a></li><li><a href=/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</a></li><li><a href=/blog/age-of-bullshit/>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</a></li><li><a href=/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
