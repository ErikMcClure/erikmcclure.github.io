So, here I present a complete list of all the computer-related or economic predictions I currently have, along with justification:</p><p><strong>Speed becomes paramount to all mature markets</strong>: People have been ignoring speed for as long as they can, because its apparently rather difficult for programmers to properly optimize programs. This is fine in emerging markets because no one knows how fast things can go. However, the more mature a market gets, the faster the consumer will notice speed problems - even little ones. People are really impatient, and a program that successfully combines both ease of use and extremely fast calculations will win over a bloated, slow, feature-filled one. This has become markedly apparent in the current cycle of web applications, and will soon spill over into just about everything that we use.</p><p>Arguments against this usually say that a faster processor will make slow programs go away, and that algorithms are the only things that make significant speed differences. There are a lot of technical reasons I could go into concerning why this is wrong, but there&rsquo;s a much easier argument: Why have my programs gotten slower over the years as my processor speed has increased? Because programmers are getting too lazy. In fact, most of the speed increases over the years have been due to algorithmic optimizations, and yet&mldr; programs are still slow. The amount of speed you can now gain over properly building an architecture and optimizing your program is so incredibly large that it is noticeable even for comparatively large computational tasks, and hence represents an economic benefit that has yet to be exploited. It&rsquo;s a little more complicated then simply making fast programs, however, involving a combination of user friendliness, speed, and avoiding feature bloat. <strong>The myth that speed doesn&rsquo;t matter in programming, however, is about to start costing companies serious money if they continue to believe it.</strong></p><p><strong>Rasterization won&rsquo;t get replaced by ray-tracing</strong>: Or rather, it won&rsquo;t get replaced any time soon. There are a lot of incredibly annoying computational issues with raytracing, and a lot of them can actually be solved by <em>combining</em> both techniques. As a result, what will happen is a slow evolution, where ray-tracing will slowly work its way into rasterization pipelines, likely starting with variable density volumetric entities, until it eventually replaces rasterization altogether once we have more computational power then we know what to do with. This probably won&rsquo;t happen for another 20 years, though.</p><p>A lot of people argue that we can do impressive amounts of raytracing even with modern computing power, and that the increased parallelism in CPUs 20 years from now will result in feasible realtime raytracing engines that can compete with modern rasterization very well. There are two problems with this: The first is that they are ignoring the fact that rasterization itself <em>also</em> benefits from parallelism, and as such it&rsquo;s rendering quality will increase as computing power does. This usually leads into the second mistake: people argue that rasterization will simply hit a ceiling and be unable to get past it, and only raytracing can produce true photorealism. These people completely fail to understand just how much stuff can be efficiently accomplished using rasterization, and also do not understand how raytracing can be combined with rasterization to achieve almost the same amount of realism for a tiny fraction of the computing cost. Other people just don&rsquo;t understand how computationally expensive the tiny nuances of photorealism are.</p><p><strong>Low-level languages will become even more important</strong>: Lots of people want low-level languages to vanish, but due to the above speed concerns, that simply isn&rsquo;t going to happen. However, business moves too fast for people to worry about low-level routines all the time, so what will happen is an increasing chasm between high speed low-level languages that are dependent on high-level languages to do complex tasks, while the high-level languages will be increasingly dependent on low-level libraries in order to deliver effective performance. Hence, language interoperability becomes incredibly important, because the programs of the future will likely be written in 2 or more languages. The ability to simply pick a language as a tool, choosing it based on what problem needs to be solved, will become invaluable. This is likely to happen very quickly, in just 5 or 10 years. At the same time, this increasingly wide division between high level and low level languages will create a vacuum that needs to be filled by&mldr;</p><p><strong>Middle-level languages</strong>: A middle-level language will be a language that allows a programmer to quickly and efficiently write a method either in the style of low-level memory management, or high-level complexity management. This would likely be accomplished with something like D, where the programmer would be able to control and override the high-level garbage collectors and variable management whenever they desire, with little to no resistance from the language syntax. While many high-level languages today attempt to make some low-level functions available, it is often clumsy and far from complete. This language would act as an intermediate compromise between the necessary low level speed hogs and high level complexity management. This transition, however, is not going to happen for probably another 10 or 20 years, due to people needing to recognize that there is a schism in the first place, along with several engineering problems that must be confronted.</p><p><strong>Education will soon fundamentally change</strong>: We&rsquo;ve been using the same, outdated rote methods of teaching for almost 150 years, slapping on in-place attempts at more modern learning, trying to work such fundamentally incompatible methods into the existing framework that refuses to change. It is becoming so economically irrational for people to continue being schooled this way that the instant an alternative comes up, it will rapidly displace the existing system. This is already happening at a small level with Khan Academy, which I believe is precipitating a fundamental change in how we learn things. We aren&rsquo;t there yet and we probably won&rsquo;t be for say, 2-3 decades, but around that time we will see a huge shift in the educational paradigm.</p><p><strong>Anti-authoritarianism becomes rampant</strong>: This one probably won&rsquo;t happen for a good 50 years, but the inklings of its beginnings have already shown up, primarily in Anonymous and the multiple middle-east government coups. Anonymous will end up being one of the most important social movements in modern history, as it matures from a group of pranksters into something that unites a large portion of humanity together. Governments will be forced to become more transparent and accountable, and debates about the effectiveness of representative democracy will rage in internet forums or whatever the future equivalent is. Part of this change will likely be influenced by a changing educational system that becomes much more effective at promoting critical thinking and individualistic problem solving skills. Extreme anti-authoritarianism, including anarchy, will become far more vocal and possibly less ignored by the public, but by necessity will remain fringe groups.</p><p><strong>The economy will become both more capitalistic and more socialist</strong>: This is not a contradiction. The huge disparity between the wealthy and the poor is reaching such an absurd level in the United States that it has created an economic disparity that can be taken advantage of. At the same time, the most successful companies are already beginning to realize that increasing competition and other capitalistic values inside their own corporations results in far more productivity and efficiency (just look at what Larry Page is doing at Google). That means that capitalistic values will become more pronounced at smaller and smaller economic tiers, while the economy at large takes on a more socialistic approach to even out the wealth distribution. I have no idea when this will happen, because it is dependent on the two arguing political parties in the united states to realize that they both want the <em>same wealth distribution</em>. They just have to stop arguing and come to a compromise to try and do something about it.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>So there you have it, my predictions for the future. Some of them might be right, others might not, others might be influenced by me planning to directly instigate them, but hopefully this was an interesting read nonetheless.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-04-17T15:54:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/future-predictions/>April 17, 2011 at 3:54pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/future-predictions/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffuture-predictions%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Future%20Predictions&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffuture-predictions%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2ffuture-predictions%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/investigating-low-level-cpu-performance/>Investigating Low-level CPU Performance</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>While reconstructing my threaded Red-Black tree data structure, I naturally assumed that due to invalid branch predictions costing significant amounts of performance, by eliminating branching in low-level data structures, one can significant enhance the performance of your application. I did some profiling and was stunned to discover that my new, optimized Red Black tree was&mldr; <em>SLOWER</em> then the old one! This can&rsquo;t be right, I eliminated several branches and streamlined the whole thing, how can it be <em>SLOWER?!</em> I tested again, and again, and again, but the results were clear - even with fluctuations of up to 5% in the results, the average speed for my new tree was roughly 7.5% larger then my old one (the following numbers are the average of 5 tests).</p><p>Old: 626699 ticks
New: 674000 ticks</p><pre class=language-cpp><code>//Old

</code></pre><p>Now, those of you familiar with CPU branching and other low-level optimizations might point out that the compiler may have optimized the old code path more effectively, leaving the new code path with extra instructions due to the extra increment and bitshift operations. <strong>Wrong.</strong> Both code paths have the <em>exact same number of instructions</em>. Furthermore, there are only <em><strong>FOUR</strong></em> instructions that are different between the two implementations (highlighted in red below).</p><span><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><b>New</b><pre>00F72DE5  mov         esi,dword ptr [esp+38h]

As a result, it may be possible for the CPU to be doing branch prediction in such a way it shaves off one instruction, which gives it a significant advantage. It may also be that the branching is just <em>faster</em> then my increment and bitshift, although I find this highly unlikely. At this point I was wondering if anything I knew about optimization held any meaning in the real world, or if everything was just a lot of guesswork and profiling because <em>what the fuck?!</em> However, it then occurred to me that there was an optimization possible for the old version - Move the if(c==0) statement to the bottom so the CPU does the (c&lt;0) and (c>0) comparisons first, since the c==0 comparison only happens once in the traversal. Naturally I was a bit skeptical of this having any effect on the assembly-rewriting, branch-predicting, impulsive teenage bitch that my CPU was at this point, but I tried it anyway.</p><p>It worked. There was a small but noticeable improvement in running time by using the old technique and rewriting the if statements as such:<pre class=language-cpp><code>c = C(key, y-&gt;_key);
if (c &lt; 0)  y = y-&gt;_left;
else if(c &gt; 0) y = y-&gt;_right;
else return y;
</code></pre></p><p>Optimized: 610161.8 Ticks</p><p>The total performance improvement over my failed optimization attempt and my more successful branch-manipulation technique is a whopping 63838.2 Ticks, or a ~10% improvement in speed, caused by simply rearranging 4 or 5 instructions. These tests were done on a randomized collection of 500000 integers, so that means the optimized version can pack in 10% more comparisons in the same period of time as the bad optimization. That&rsquo;s 550000 vs 500000 elements, which seems to suggest that delicate optimization, even in modern CPUs, can have significant speed improvements. Those of you who say that toying around with low level code can&rsquo;t infer significant performance increases should probably reconsider exactly what you&rsquo;re claiming. This wouldn&rsquo;t directly translate to 50000 extra players on your server, but a 10% increase in speed isn&rsquo;t statistically insignificant.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-04-10T17:06:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/investigating-low-level-cpu-performance/>April 10, 2011 at 5:06pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/investigating-low-level-cpu-performance/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;4 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2finvestigating-low-level-cpu-performance%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Investigating%20Low-level%20CPU%20Performance&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2finvestigating-low-level-cpu-performance%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2finvestigating-low-level-cpu-performance%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/bullying-never-stops/>The Bullying Never Stops</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>I believe that at a young age, I was physically harassed a couple of times, but I have long since forgotten. What I haven&rsquo;t forgotten is the intellectual bullying I was subjected to during 7th grade. There is not a day that goes by that my actions are not subtly influenced by when I misprounced &ldquo;subtle&rdquo; as &ldquo;sub&rdquo;-&ldquo;tle&rdquo; and was made a laughingstock in front of my honors class, several of whom told me that I was a hopeless idiot who couldn&rsquo;t do anything right. This was reinforced about three years later after my inept social skills earned me an enormous tirade from someone whom I held in high regard who then told me I was a useless pile of shit whose attempts at being helpful had only slowed things down, and that after 14 months I had contributed absolutely nothing to the project that was actually going to be used.</p><p>Years later, memories of these moments would begin to haunt me in high school, where the bullying had largely stopped, or so I had thought. It wasn&rsquo;t long before programmers started telling me how I should do things and what was the right thing to do. They told me that performance didn&rsquo;t matter, that I should never learn C++, that interpreted languages are the future. I disagreed with them. I gave reasons for my disagreement, and I was ridiculed and laughed at. At one point I somehow ended up in a game development IRC channel and mentioned that I preferred C++ over .net, and when pressed for justification I explained how I had to sort 10000 images 60 times a second, which requires delicate memory management that is difficult to do in C#.</p><p>Naturally, they told me I should have just used Array.Sort(), because the time required to render the images was far greater then the sorting time. The utter stupidity of this answer astonished me; I was in a game development channel and they were obtusely disregarding the fact that games do things other then draw pictures on the screen, not to mention having to fill up an array with images every frame due to culling. I mentioned this to a friend of mine, who then admitted that he had been in the same channel a few months back, and they had instead ridiculed him for using C# instead of C++.</p><p>This is when I realized that the bullying never stopped - it just changed. Now the bullies are programmers who ridicule other programmers no matter what they do. They are patent trolls who sue everyone just because they can. They are huge companies that squash smaller ones just because they don&rsquo;t like them, wiggle out of taxes and then get away with it because they&rsquo;re the teacher&rsquo;s pet. Except now, the teacher is the U.S. Government, and she&rsquo;s accepting bribes.</p><p>The bullies never went away, they just changed. I know from 7th grade that bullies aren&rsquo;t just brainless jocks, they&rsquo;re stuck-up intellectual assholes who take advantage of other people just because they can. Now those assholes are in charge of $40 billion companies, have friends in the teacher&rsquo;s lounge, and your parents aren&rsquo;t there to help you anymore.</p><p>Some people argue that everyone is an adult now, and much more mature then a 7th grader. <strong>Yeah, right.</strong> We have people in Texas who decided to <a href=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/03/12/texas-removes-thomas-jefferson-from-teaching-standard/>remove Thomas Jefferson</a> from their history curriculum. We have the <a href=http://www.pcworld.com/article/223431/riaa_thinks_limewire_owes_75_trillion_in_damages.html>RIAA demanding $75 trillion</a> from Limewire, which more then the <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;biw=1400&amp;bih=892&amp;q=world+GDP&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;oq=">total GDP of the entire world</a>. We have <a href=http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/04/how-i-got-sued-by-facebook.html>Facebook suing someone</a> because they didn&rsquo;t get written permission to crawl publically accessible data. Anyone who thinks we&rsquo;re more mature then a bunch of screaming toddlers who keep throwing a fit when someone steals a block from their block tower has apparently never dealt with the business world. Subtlety is only difference between adults and toddlers. At least the toddlers have someone to tell them how silly they&rsquo;re being.</p><p>Now the bullies are running rampant and the teachers don&rsquo;t care. High school never ends; the bullying never stops. If you don&rsquo;t do what people expect you to do (like an entrepreneur), then you&rsquo;d better be ready to deal with endless attacks from all sides from everyone who will hate you for absolutely no reason at all. You&rsquo;re at war with ideas, and you are the battlefield. Are you ready?</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2011-03-28T14:22:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/bullying-never-stops/>March 28, 2011 at 2:22pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/bullying-never-stops/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fbullying-never-stops%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Bullying%20Never%20Stops&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fbullying-never-stops%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fbullying-never-stops%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/im-failure/>The IM Failure</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>This is completely insane. First, Microsoft has rendered its new Windows Live Messenger (previously MSN messenger) almost completely useless.</p><ul><li>No more handwriting</li><li>No more setting your name to anything other then your first and last name.</li><li>All links you click on redirect you to a page from Microsoft warning you about the dangers of the internet, requiring you to click a link to proceed.</li><li>All photosharing is now incompatible with previous versions of messenger, and instead of actually just sending the file, it will instead fail completely.</li><li>Any youtube video, image, or any other link you copy paste into the window will automatically trigger a sharing session whether you like it or not.</li><li>It will, at times, randomly decide none of your messages are getting through.</li><li>You can no longer have a one-sided webcam session. WLM will simply leave your webcam as a giant, useless blank image underneath your conversation partner, demanding that you buy a webcam.</li><li>It&rsquo;s new emoticons must have been influenced by H.R.Giger (you can&rsquo;t turn them off and leave custom ones on).</li></ul><p>Naturally I wasn&rsquo;t able to put up with this for very long and moved to pidgin. Pidgin has many issues of its own, including an ass-backwards UI design and this really annoying tendency to create a new popup window to confirm every single file transfer, among other truly bizarre UI design elements. I was willing to put up with these, because honestly pidgin is designed for Linux and just happens to work on windows too, and their libpurple library is the basis of almost all open-source IM clients.</p><p>Pidgin, however, has now stopped working as well. It now spastically refuses to connect to the MSN service because the SSL certificate is invalid. I can appreciate it trying to protect my privacy, but there is no way to override this. So, pidgin is now out of the question.</p><p>Well, how about Trillian? During its installation, Trillian informed me that &ldquo;The Adobe Flash 9.0 plugin for Internet Explorer could not be found. This plugin is required for some of Trillian&rsquo;s features.&rdquo;</p><p>Trillian is no longer on my computer.</p><p>After digging around on wikipedia, I came up with Miranda IM, which seemed to be my last hope for a multi-protocol service that didn&rsquo;t suck total ass. It supported WLM, AIM, and&mldr; not google talk? Not XMPP, the most useful extensible open source protocol? Um, ok. Its UI design is more compact then Pidgin but arguably even worse, and it doesn&rsquo;t support custom emoticons or hardly ANYTHING on the WLM protocol. It served its purpose by at least letting me log the fuck in like I wanted to, though.</p><p>This is driving me up the wall. If anything else happens, I&rsquo;m going to snap and simply <em>make time</em> to work on <em><strong>my own</strong></em> IM client implementation that doesn&rsquo;t have <strong>glaring design flaws</strong> like <em>every single other one</em>. Honestly, requiring the Internet Explorer flash plugin to run everything? What the fuck are they smoking? What the hell is wrong with these developers?!</p><p>If only D had a good development environment, then I could write my IM client in it.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2010-11-18T03:56:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/im-failure/>November 18, 2010 at 3:56am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/im-failure/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fim-failure%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20IM%20Failure&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fim-failure%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fim-failure%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/how-to-train-your-dragon/>How To Train Your Dragon</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>&mldr;takes its place as one of my favorite movies of all time. The characters are brilliant, the story is superb, the music is divine, and the cinematography is breathtaking. It was so good it gave me the last bit of inspiration I needed to make <a href=http://soundcloud.com/erik_mcclure/inmydreams>this (WIP)</a>, and as a result my attempts at finishing CEGUI this weekend were thrown out the window. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll try a first draft of the drums and possible a couple of effects before extending the main chorus. These new samples are amazing - it&rsquo;s like I can do everything I ever wanted. Now the hard part is figuring out what I want. I threw in a bunch of binaural sounds thanks to <a href=http://www.freesound.org>the free sound project</a>, which has been added to my mental list of useful resource sites.</p><p>I finally got the entire CEGUI dependency chain statically recompiled and have wrapped everything into a giant megadll with no dependencies. I then discovered that for all this time, PlaneShader&rsquo;s Release mode had been defaulting to __fastcall. I have no idea how it has even been compiling with my other projects; the reason I don&rsquo;t change the calling convention is because it breaks absolutely everything. For good measure I threw a few extra BSS_FASTCALL into the really high traffic functions.</p><p>So, if it weren&rsquo;t for my sudden musical inspiration, I&rsquo;d be rebuilding the GUI in CEGUI, although I also need to figure out how the heck it renders text, because I need a text renderer, and I can&rsquo;t just require CEGUI&rsquo;s to be used. I need to build a very basic but supercrazyfast text renderer, because holy shit is directX bad at that.</p><p>After that I finalize a midpoint release of planeshader and move to reimplementing Decoherence&rsquo;s GUI in CEGUI, then FINALLY get to those joints that were supposed to be done ages ago.</p><p>Of course, I also have a midterm wednesday. Fuck.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2010-10-18T04:42:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-to-train-your-dragon/>October 18, 2010 at 4:42am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/how-to-train-your-dragon/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-train-your-dragon%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20To%20Train%20Your%20Dragon&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-train-your-dragon%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-train-your-dragon%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><div class=pager><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/23>Newer</a></li><li style=text-align:center><a href=/blog/>Home</a></li><li style=text-align:right><a href=/blog/page/25>Older</a></li></ul></div></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2024</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/>Measuring Competence Is Epistemic Hell</a></li><li><a href=/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/>We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/>People Can't Care About Everything</a></li><li><a href=/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</a></li><li><a href=/blog/age-of-bullshit/>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</a></li><li><a href=/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
