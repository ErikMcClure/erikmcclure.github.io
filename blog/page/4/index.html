As an applied mathematician whose coding involves plenty of multiplication, I was not happy to hear this. Nobody who does math actually memorizes times tables, and furthermore, forcing a child to memorize <em>anything</em> is probably the worst possible thing you can do in modern society. No one should <em>memorize</em> their times tables, they should learn how to <em>calculate them</em>. Forcing children to memorize useless equations for no reason is a great way to either ensure they hate math, teach them they should blindly memorize and believe anything adults tell them, or both. So for any parents who wish to teach their children how to be critical thinkers and give them an advantage on their next math test, I am going to describe how to derive the entire times tables with only 12 rules.</p><ol><li><p>Anything multiplied by 1 is itself. Note that I said <em>anything</em>, that includes fractions, pies, cars, the moon, or anything else you can think of. Multiplying it by 1 just gives you back the same result.</p></li><li><p>Any number multiplied by 10 has a zero added on the end. 1 becomes 10, 2 becomes 20, 72 becomes 720, 9999 becomes 99990, etc.</p></li><li><p>Any single digit multiplied by 11 simply adds itself on the end instead of 0. 1 becomes 11, 2 becomes 22, 5 becomes 55, etc. This is because you never need to multiply something by eleven. Instead, multiply it by 10 (add a zero to it) then add itself.<div class=math>\[ \begin{aligned} 11*11 = 11*(10 + 1) = 11*10 + 11 = 110 + 11 = 121\\ 12*11 = 12*(10 + 1) = 12*10 + 12 = 120 + 12 = 132 \end{aligned} \]</div></p></li><li><p>You can always reverse the numbers being multiplied and the same result comes out. <span class=math>$$ 12*2 = 2*12 $$</span>, <span class=math>$$ 8*7 = 7*8 $$</span>, etc. This is a simple rule, but it&rsquo;s very easy to forget, so keep it in mind.</p></li><li><p>Anything multiplied by 2 is doubled, or added to itself, but you only need to do this up to 9. For example, <span class=math>$$ 4*2 = 4 + 4 = 8 $$</span>. Alternatively, you can count up by 2 that many times:<div class=math>\[ 4*2 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]</div>To multiply any large number by two, double each individual digit and <em>carry the result</em>. Because you multiply each digit by 2 separately, the highest result you can get from this is 18, so you will only ever carry a 1, just like in addition.<div class=math>\[ \begin{aligned} \begin{matrix} 3 & 6\\ & 2\\ \hline & \\ & \\ \hline &  \end{matrix}\quad \begin{matrix} 3 & 6\\ & 2\\ \hline 1 & 2\\ & \\ \hline &  \end{matrix}\quad \begin{matrix} 3 & 6\\ & 2\\ \hline 1 & 2\\ 6 & \\ \hline &  \end{matrix}\quad \begin{matrix} 3 & 6\\ & 2\\ \hline 1 & 2\\ 6 & \\ \hline 7 & 2 \end{matrix} \end{aligned}  \]</div>This method is why multiplying anything by 2 is one of the easiest operations in math, and as a result the rest of our times table rules are going to rely heavily on it. Don&rsquo;t worry about memorizing these results - you&rsquo;ll memorize them whether you want to or not simply because of how often you use them.</p></li><li><p>Any number multiplied by 3 is multiplied by 2 and then added to itself. For example:<div class=math>\[ 6*3 = 6*(2 + 1) = 6*2 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18 \]</div>Alternatively, you can add the number to itself 3 times: <span class=math>$$ 3*3 = 3 + 3 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 $$</span></p></li><li><p>Any number multiplied by 4 is simply multiplied by 2 twice. For example: <span class=math>$$ 7*4 = 7*2*2 = 14*2 = 28 $$</span></p></li><li><p>Any number multiplied by 5 is the same number multiplied by 4 and then added to itself.<div class=math>\[ 6*5 = 6*(4 + 1) = 6*4 + 6 = 6*2*2 + 6 = 12*2 + 6 = 24 + 6 = 30 \]</div>Note that I used our rule for 4 here to break it up and calculate it using only 2. Once kids learn division, they will notice that it is often easier to calculate 5 by multiplying by 10 and halving the result, but we assume no knowledge of division.</p></li><li><p>Any number multiplied by 8 is multiplied by 4 and then by 2, which means it&rsquo;s actually just multiplied by 2 three times. For example: <span class=math>$$ 7*8 = 7*4*2 = 7*2*2*2 = 14*2*2 = 28*2 = 56 $$</span></p></li><li><p>Never multiply anything by 12. Instead, multiply it by 10, then add itself multiplied by 2. For example: <span class=math>$$ 12*12 = 12*(10 + 2) = 12*10 + 12*2 = 120 + 24 = 144 $$</span></p></li><li><p>Multiplying any single digit number by 9 results in a number whose digits always add up to nine, and whose digits decrease in the right column while increasing in the left column.<div class=math>\[ \begin{aligned} 9 * 1 = 09\\ 9 * 2 = 18\\ 9 * 3 = 27\\ 9 * 4 = 36\\ 9 * 5 = 45\\ 9 * 6 = 54\\ 9 * 7 = 63\\ 9 * 8 = 72\\ 9 * 9 = 81 \end{aligned} \]</div>10, 11, and 12 can be calculated using rules for those numbers.</p></li><li><p>For both 6 and 7, we already have rules for all the other numbers, so you just need to memorize 3 results:<div class=math>\[ \begin{aligned} 6*6 = 36\\ 6*7 = 42\\ 7*7 = 49 \end{aligned} \]</div>Note that <span class=math>$$ 7*6 = 6*7 = 42 $$</span>. This is where people often forget about being able to reverse the numbers. Every single other multiplication involving 7 or 6 can be calculated using a rule for another number.</p></li></ol><p>And there you have it. Instead of trying to memorize a bunch of numbers, kids can learn <em>rules</em> that build on top of each other, each taking advantage of the rules established before it. It&rsquo;s much more engaging then trying to memorize a giant table of meaningless numbers, a task that&rsquo;s so mind-numbingly boring I can&rsquo;t imagine forcing an adult to do it, let alone a small child. More importantly, this task teaches you what math is <em>really</em> about. It&rsquo;s not about numbers, or adding things together, or memorizing a bunch of formulas. It&rsquo;s establishing simple rules, and then combining those rules together into more complex rules you can use to solve more complex problems.</p><p>This also establishes a fundamental connection to computer science that is often glossed over. Both math and programming are <strong>repeated abstraction and generalization</strong>. It&rsquo;s about combining simple rules into a more generalized rule, which can then be abstracted into a simpler form and combined to create even more complex rules. Programs start with machine instructions, while math starts with propositions. Programs have functions, and math has theorems. Both build on top of previous results to create more powerful and expressive tools. Both require a spark of creativity to recognize similarities between seemingly unrelated concepts and unite them in a more generalized framework.</p><p>We can demonstrate all of this simply by refusing to memorize our times tables.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2018-01-01T11:37:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-to-avoid-memorizing-times-tables/>January 1, 2018 at 11:37am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/how-to-avoid-memorizing-times-tables/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;1 comment</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-avoid-memorizing-times-tables%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20To%20Avoid%20Memorizing%20Times%20Tables&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-avoid-memorizing-times-tables%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-to-avoid-memorizing-times-tables%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/integrating-luajit-and-autogenerating-c/>Integrating LuaJIT and Autogenerating C Bindings In Visual Studio</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p><a href=https://www.lua.org/>Lua</a> is a popular scripting language due to its tight integration with C. <a href=http://luajit.org/>LuaJIT</a> is an extremely fast JIT compiler for Lua that can be integrated into your game, which also provides an <a href=http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html>FFI Library</a> that directly interfaces with C functions, eliminating most overhead. However, the FFI library only accepts a subset of the C standard. Specifically, <strong>&ldquo;C declarations are not passed through a C pre-processor, yet. No pre-processor tokens are allowed, except for #pragma pack.&rdquo;</strong> The website suggests running the header file through a preprocesser stage, but I have yet to find a LuaJIT tutorial that actually explains how to do this. Instead, all the examples simply copy+paste the function prototype into the Lua file itself. Doing this with makefiles and GCC is trivial, because you just have to add a compile step using <a href=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.1/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html>the <code>-E</code> option</a>, but integrating this with Visual Studio is more difficult. In addition, I&rsquo;ll show you how to properly load scripts and modify the PATH lookup variable so your game can have a proper <code>scripts</code> folder instead of dumping everything in <code>bin</code>.</p><h5 id=compilation>Compilation</h5><p>To begin, we need to <a href=http://luajit.org/download.html>download LuaJIT</a> and get it to actually compile. Doing this manually isn&rsquo;t too difficult, simply open an x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (or x86 Native Tools if you want 32-bit), navigate to <code>src/msvcbuild.bat</code> and run <code>msvcbuild.bat</code>. The default options will build an x64 or x86 dll with dynamic linking to the CRT. If you want a static lib file, you need to run it with the <code>static</code> option. If you want static linking to the CRT so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with that annoying Visual Studio Runtime Library crap, you&rsquo;ll have to modify the .bat file directly. Specifically, you need to find <code>%LJCOMPILE% /MD</code> and change it to <code>%LJCOMPILE% /MT</code>. This will then compile the static lib or dll with static CRT linking to match your other projects.</p><p>This is a bit of a pain, and recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to automate my build process and dependencies using <a href=https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg>vcpkg</a> to act as a C++ package manager. A port of LuaJIT is included in the latest update of vcpkg, but if you want one that always statically links to the CRT, you can <a href=https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/luajit>get it here</a>.</p><p>An important note: the build instructions for LuaJIT state that you should copy the lua scripts contained in <code>src/jit</code> to your application folder. What it doesn&rsquo;t mention is that this is <em>optional</em> - those scripts contain debugging instructions for the JIT engine, which you probably don&rsquo;t need. It will work just fine without them.</p><p>Once you have LuaJIT built, you should add it&rsquo;s library file to your project. This library file is called <strong>lua51.lib</strong> (and the dll is <strong>lua51.dll</strong>), because LuaJIT is designed as a drop-in replacement for the default Lua runtime. Now we need to actually load Lua in our program and integrate it with our code. To do this, use <code>lua_open()</code>, which returns a <code>lua_State*</code> pointer. You will need that <code>lua_State*</code> pointer for everything else you do, so store it somewhere easy to get to. If you are building a game using an Entity Component System, it makes sense to build a <code>LuaSystem</code> that stores your <code>lua_State*</code> pointer.</p><h5 id=initialization>Initialization</h5><p>The next step is to load in all the standard Lua libraries using <code>luaL_openlibs(L)</code>. Normally, you shouldn&rsquo;t do this if you need script sandboxing for player-created scripts. However, <strong>LuaJIT&rsquo;s FFI library is inherently unsafe</strong>. Any script with access to the FFI library can call any kernel API it wants, so you should be extremely careful about using LuaJIT if this is a use-case for your game. We can also register any C functions we want to the old-fashioned way via <code>lua_register</code>, but this is only useful for functions that don&rsquo;t have C analogues (due to having multiple return values, etc).</p><p>There is one function in particular that you probably want to overload, and that is the <code>print()</code> function. By default, Lua will simply print to standard out, but if you aren&rsquo;t redirecting standard out to your in-game console, you probably have your own <code>std::ostream</code> (or even a custom stream class) that is sent all log messages. By overloading <code>print()</code>, we can have our Lua scripts automatically write to both our log file and our in-game console, which is extremely useful. Here is a complete re-implementation of <code>print</code> that outputs to an arbitrary <code>std::ostream&</code> object:<pre class=language-cpp><code>int PrintOut(lua_State *L, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  int n = lua_gettop(L);  /* number of arguments */
  if(!n)
    return 0;
  int i;
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;tostring&#34;);
  for(i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
  {
    const char *s;
    lua_pushvalue(L, -1);  /* function to be called */
    lua_pushvalue(L, i);   /* value to print */
    lua_call(L, 1, 1);
    s = lua_tostring(L, -1);  /* get result */
    if(s == NULL)
      return luaL_error(L, LUA_QL(&#34;tostring&#34;) &#34; must return a string to &#34;
        LUA_QL(&#34;print&#34;));
    if(i &gt; 1) out &lt;&lt; &#34;\t&#34;;
    out &lt;&lt; s;
    lua_pop(L, 1);  /* pop result */
  }
  out &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>To overwrite the existing <code>print</code> function, we need to first define a Lua compatible shim function. In this example, I pass <code>std::cout</code> as the target stream:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int lua_Print(lua_State *L)
{
  return PrintOut(L, std::cout);
}
</code></pre>Now we simply register our <code>lua_Print</code> function using <code>lua_register(L, "print", &amp;lua_Print)</code>. If we were doing this in a <code>LuaSystem</code> object, our constructor would look like this:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>LuaSystem::LuaSystem()
{
  L = lua_open();
  luaL_openlibs(L);
  lua_register(L, &#34;print&#34;, &amp;lua_Print);
}
</code></pre>To clean up our Lua instance, we need to both trigger a final GC iteration to clean up any dangling memory, and then we call <code>lua_close(L)</code>, so our destructor would look like this:<pre class=language-cpp><code>LuaSystem::~LuaSystem()
{
  lua_gc(L, LUA_GCCOLLECT, 0);
  lua_close(L);
  L = 0;
}
</code></pre></p><h5 id=loadings-scripts-via-require>Loadings Scripts via Require</h5><p>At this point most tutorials skip to the part where you load a Lua script and write &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;, but we aren&rsquo;t done yet. Integrating Lua into your game means loading scripts and/or arbitrary strings as Lua code while properly resolving dependencies. If you don&rsquo;t do this, any one of your scripts that relies on another script will have to do <code>require("full/path/to/script.lua")</code>. We also face another problem - if we want to have a <code>scripts</code> folder where we simply automatically load every single script into our workspace, simply loading them all can cause duplicated code, because <code>luaL_loadfile</code> does <em>not</em> have any knowledge of <code>require</code>. You can solve this by simply loading a single <code>bootstrap.lua</code> script which then loads all your game&rsquo;s scripts via <code>require</code>, but we&rsquo;re going to build a much more robust solution.</p><p>First, we need to modify Lua&rsquo;s <code>PATH</code> variable, or the variable that controls where it looks up scripts relative to our current directory. This function will append a path (which should be of the form <code>"path/to/scripts/?.lua"</code>) to the beginning of the <code>PATH</code> variable, giving it highest priority, which you can then use to add as many <code>script</code> directories as you want in your game, and any lua script from any of those folders will then be able to <code>require()</code> a script from any other folder in <code>PATH</code> without a problem. Obviously, you should probably only add one or two folders, because you don&rsquo;t want to deal with potential name conflicts in your script files.<pre class=language-cpp><code>int AppendPath(lua_State *L, const char* path)
{
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;package&#34;);
  lua_getfield(L, -1, &#34;path&#34;); // get field &#34;path&#34; from table at top of stack (-1)
  std::string npath = path;
  npath.append(&#34;;&#34;);
  npath.append(lua_tostring(L, -1)); // grab path string from top of stack
  lua_pop(L, 1);
  lua_pushstring(L, npath.c_str());
  lua_setfield(L, -2, &#34;path&#34;); // set the field &#34;path&#34; in table at -2 with value at top of stack
  lua_pop(L, 1); // get rid of package table from top of stack
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>Next, we need a way to load all of our scripts using <code>require()</code> so that Lua properly resolves the dependencies. To do this, we create a function in C that literally calls the <code>require()</code> function for us:<pre class=language-cpp><code>int Require(lua_State *L,const char *name)
{
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;require&#34;);
  lua_pushstring(L, name);
  int r = lua_pcall(L, 1, 1, 0);
  if(!r)
    lua_pop(L, 1);
  WriteError(L, r, std::cout);
  return r;
}
</code></pre>By using this to load all our scripts, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about loading them in any particular order - <code>require</code> will ensure everything gets loaded correctly. An important note here is <code>WriteError()</code>, which is a generic error handling function that processes Lua errors and writes them to a log. All errors in lua will return a nonzero error code, and will <em>usually</em> push a string containing the error message to the stack, which must then be popped off, or it&rsquo;ll mess things up later.<pre class=language-cpp><code>void WriteError(lua_State *L, int r, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  if(!r)
    return;
  if(!lua_isnil(L, -1)) // Check if a string was pushed

One way to do this is to just copy+paste your C function definitions into a Lua file in your scripts folder that is then automatically loaded. This, however, is a pain in the butt and is error-prone. We want to have a <em>single source of truth</em> for our function definitions, which means defining our entire LuaJIT C API in a single header file, which is then loaded directly into LuaJIT. Predictably, we will accomplish this by abusing the C preprocessor:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>#ifndef __LUA_API_H__
#define __LUA_API_H__

#ifndef LUA_EXPORTS
#define LUAFUNC(ret, name, ...) ffi.cdef[[ ret lua_##name(__VA_ARGS__); ]]; name = ffi.C.lua_##name
local ffi = require(&#34;ffi&#34;)
ffi.cdef[[ // Initial struct definitions
#else
#define LUAFUNC(ret, name, ...) ret __declspec(dllexport) lua_##name(__VA_ARGS__)
extern &#34;C&#34; { // Ensure C linkage is being used
#endif

struct GameInfo
{
  uint64_t DashTail;
  uint64_t MaxDash;
};

typedef const char* CSTRING; // VC++ complains about having const char* in macros, so we typedef it here

#ifndef LUA_EXPORTS
]] // End struct definitions
#endif

  LUAFUNC(CSTRING, GetGameName);
  LUAFUNC(CSTRING, IntToString, int);
  LUAFUNC(void, setdeadzone, float);

#ifdef Everglade_EXPORTS
}
#endif

#endif
</code></pre>The key idea here is to use macros such that, when we pass this through the preprocessor <em>without</em> any predefined constants, it will magically turn into a valid Lua script. However, when we compile it in our C++ project, our project defines <code>LUA_EXPORTS</code>, and the result is a valid C header. Our C <code>LUAFUNC</code> is set up so that we&rsquo;re using C linkage for our structs and functions, and that we&rsquo;re <em>exporting the function</em> via <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code>. This obviously only works for Visual Studio so you&rsquo;ll want to set up a macro for the GCC version, but I will warn you that VC++ got really cranky when i tried to use a macro for that in my code, so you may end up having to redefine the entire <code>LUAFUNC</code> macro for each compiler.</p><p>At this point, we have a bit of a choice to make. It&rsquo;s more convenient to have the C functions available in the global namespace, which is what this script does, because this simplifies calling them from an interactive console. However, <strong>using <code>ffi.C.FunctionName</code> is significantly faster</strong>. Technically the fastest way is declaring <code>local C = ffi.C</code> at the top of a file and then calling the functions via <code>C.FunctionName</code>. Luckily, importing the functions into the global namespace does not preclude us from using the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; way of calling them, so our script here imports them into the global namespace for ease of use, but in our scripts we can use the <code>C.FunctionName</code> method instead. Thus, when outputting our Lua script, our <code>LUAFUNC</code> macro wraps our function definition in a LuaJIT <code>ffi.cdef</code> block, and then runs a <em>second</em> Lua statement that brings the function into the global namespace. This is why we have an initial <code>ffi.cdef</code> code block for the structs up top, so we can include that second lua statement after each function definition.</p><p>Now we need to set up our compilation so that Visual Studio generates this file without any predefined constants and outputs the resulting lua script to our <code>scripts</code> folder, where our other in-game scripts can automatically load it from. We can accomplish this using a Post-Build Event (under Configuration Properties -> Build Events -> Post-Build Event), which then runs the following code:<pre class=language-cil><code>CL LuaAPI.h /P /EP /u
COPY &#34;LuaAPI.i&#34; &#34;../bin/your/script/folder/LuaAPI.lua&#34; /Y
</code></pre>Visual Studio can sometimes be finicky about that newline, but if you put in two statements on two separate lines, it should run both commands sequentially. You may have to edit the project file directly to convince it to actually do this. The key line here is <code>CL LuaAPI.h /P /EP /u</code>, which tells the compiler to preprocess the file and output it to a <code>*.i</code> file. There is no option to configure the output file, it will always be the exact same file but with a <code>.i</code> extension, so we have to copy and rename it ourselves to our scripts folder using the <code>COPY</code> command.</p><h5 id=loading-and-calling-lua-code>Loading and Calling Lua Code</h5><p>We are now set to load all our lua scripts in our script folder via <code>Require</code>, but what if we want an interactive Lua console? There are lua functions that read strings, but to make this simpler, I will provide a function that loads a lua script from an arbitrary <code>std::istream</code> and outputs to an arbitrary <code>std::ostream</code>:<pre class=language-cpp><code>const char* _luaStreamReader(lua_State *L, void *data, size_t *size)
{
  static char buf[CHUNKSIZE];
  reinterpret_cast&lt;std::istream*&gt;(data)-&gt;read(buf, CHUNKSIZE);
  *size = reinterpret_cast&lt;std::istream*&gt;(data)-&gt;gcount();
  return buf;
}

int Load(lua_State *L, std::istream&amp; s, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  int r = lua_load(L, &amp;_luaStreamReader, &amp;s, 0);

  if(!r)
  {
    r = lua_pcall(L, 0, LUA_MULTRET, 0);
    if(!r)
      PrintOut(L, out);
  }

  WriteError(L, r, out);
  return r;
}
</code></pre>Of course, the other question is how to call Lua functions from our C++ code directly. There are many, <em>many</em> different implementations of this available, of varying amounts of safety and completeness, but to get you started, here is a very simple implementation in C++ using templates. Note that this does not handle errors - you can change it to use <code>lua_pcall</code> and check the return code, but <a href=http://www.knightsgame.org.uk/blog/2012/09/03/notes-on-luac-error-handling/>handling arbitrary Lua errors is nontrivial</a>.<pre class=language-cpp><code>template&lt;class T, int N&gt;

I pointed out that it was never designed for large-scale attacks, and that discord&rsquo;s own rate-limiting would likely make it useless. He revealed he was selling spambot accounts at a rate of about $1 for 100 unique accounts and that he was being attacked by a rival spammer. My anti-spam bot had been dragged into a turf war between two spambot networks. We discussed possible mitigation strategies for worst-case scenarios, but agreed that most of them would involve false-positives and that discord showed no interest in fixing how exploitable their API was. I hoped that I would never have to implement such extreme measures into my bot.</p><p>Yesterday, our server was attacked by over 40 spambots, and after discord&rsquo;s astonishingly useless &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; response, I was forced to do exactly that.</p><h5 id=a-brief-history-of-discord-bots>A Brief History of Discord Bots</h5><p>Discord is built on a REST API, which was reverse engineered by late 2015 and used to make unofficial bots. To test out their bots, they would hunt for servers to &ldquo;raid&rdquo;, invite their bots to the server, then spam so many messages it would softlock the client, because discord still didn&rsquo;t have any rate limiting. Naturally, as the designated punching bags of the internet, furries/bronies/Twilight fans/slash fiction writers/etc. were among the first targets. The attack on our server was so severe it took us almost 5 minutes of wrestling with an unresponsive client to ban them. Ironically, a few of the more popular bots today, such as &ldquo;BooBot&rdquo;, are banned as a result of that attack, because the first thing the bot creator did was use it to raid our server.</p><p>I immediately went to work building an anti-spam bot that muted anyone sending more than 4 messages per second. Building a program in a hostile environment like this is much different from writing a desktop app or a game, because the bot had to be bulletproof - it had to rate-limit itself and could not be allowed to crash, <em>ever</em>. Any bug that allowed a user to crash the bot was treated as P0, because it could be used by an attacker to cripple the server. Despite using a very simplistic spam detection algorithm, this turned out to be highly effective. Of course, back then, discord didn&rsquo;t have rate limiting, or verification, or role hierarchies, or searching chat logs, or even a way to look up where your last ping was, so most spammers were probably not accustomed to having to deal with <em>any</em> kind of anti-spam system.</p><p>I added raid detection, autosilence, an isolation channel, and join alerts, but eventually we were targeted by a group from 4chan&rsquo;s /pol/ board. Because this was a sustained attack, they began crafting spam attacks timed just below the anti-spam threshold. This forced me to implement a much more sophisticated anti-spam system, using a heat algorithm with a linear decay rate, which is still in use today. This improved anti-spam system eventually made the /pol/ group give up entirely. I&rsquo;m honestly amazed the simplistic &ldquo;X messages in Y seconds&rdquo; approach worked as long as it did.</p><p>Of course, none of this can defend against a large scale attack. As I learned by my chance encounter with an actual spammer, it was getting easier and easier to amass an army of spambots to assault a channel instead of just using one or two.</p><h5 id=anatomy-of-a-modern-spambot-attack>Anatomy Of A Modern Spambot Attack</h5><p>At peak times (usually during summer break), our server gets raided 1-2 times <em>per day</em>. These minor raids are often just 2-3 tweens who either attempt to troll the chat, or use a basic user script to spam an offensive message. Roughly 60-70% of these raids are either painfully obvious or immediately trigger the anti-spam bot. About 20% of the raids involve slightly intelligent attempts to troll the chat by being annoying without breaking the rules, which usually take about 5-10 minutes to be &ldquo;exposed&rdquo;. About 5-10% of the raids are large, involving 8 or more people, but they are also very obvious and can be easily confined to an isolation channel. Problems arise, however, with large <em>spambot</em> raids. Below is a timeline of the recent spambot attack on our server:</p><div style=width:100%;height:150px;background:#dfdfdf;border-radius:3px><div style=padding:10px;height:125px;position:relative><div style=transform:rotate(90deg);position:absolute;left:-1em;top:65px>messages</div><div class=datachart style=display:flex;width:320px;height:100%;align-items:flex-end><div class=ychart style="flex-shrink:0;font-size:.8em;width:3em;height:100%;padding-right:.2em;border-right:solid 1px #999;display:flex;justify-content:space-between;flex-direction:column;align-items:flex-end"></div></div><div style=width:100%><div style="border-top:solid 1px #999;font-size:.8em;position:relative;margin-left:3.2em"><div style=position:absolute;left:0>19:41:25</div><div style=position:absolute;left:80px>19:41:45</div><div style=position:absolute;left:160px>19:42:05</div><div style=position:absolute;left:240px>19:42:25</div><div style=position:absolute;left:320px>19:42:45</div></div></div></div></div><p>This was a botched raid, but the bots that actually worked started spamming within 5 seconds of joining, giving the moderators a very narrow window to respond. The real problem, however, is that so many of them joined, the bot&rsquo;s API calls to add a role to silence them were rate-limited. They also sent messages once every 0.9 seconds, which is designed to get around Discord&rsquo;s rate limiting. This amounted to 33 messages sent every second, but it was difficult for the anti-spam to detect. Had the spambots reduced their spam cadence to 3 seconds or more, this attack could have bypassed the anti-spam detection <em>entirely</em>. My bot now instigates a lockdown by raising the verification level when a raid is detected, but it simply can&rsquo;t silence users fast enough to deal with hundreds of spambots, so at some point the moderators must use a mass ban function. Of course, banning is restricted by the global rate limit, because <strong><a href=https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#create-guild-ban>Discord has no mass ban API endpoint</a></strong>, but luckily the global rate limit is something like 50 requests per second, so if you&rsquo;re <em>only</em> banning people, you&rsquo;re probably okay.</p><p>However, a hostile attacker could sneak bots in one-by-one every 10 minutes or so, avoiding setting off the raid alarm, and then activate them all at once. 500 bots sending randomized messages chosen from an English dictionary once every 5 seconds after sneaking them in over a 48 hour period is the ultimate attack, and one that is almost impossible to defend against, because this also bypasses the 10-minute verification level. As a weapon of last resort, I added a command that immediately bans all users that sent their first message within the past two minutes, but, again, banning is subject to the <a href=https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits>global rate limit!</a> In fact, the rate limits can change at any time, and while message deletion has a higher rate limit for bots, bans don&rsquo;t.</p><p>The only other option is to disable the @everyone role from being able to speak on any channel, but you have to do this on a <em>per channel basis</em>, because Discord ignores you if you attempt to globally disable sending message permissions for @everyone. Even then, creating an &ldquo;approved&rdquo; role doesn&rsquo;t work because any automated assignment could be defeated by adding bots one by one. The only defense a small Discord server has is to require moderator approval for every single new user, which isn&rsquo;t a solution - you&rsquo;ve just given up having a public Discord server. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until any angry 13-year-old can buy a sophisticated attack with a week&rsquo;s allowance. What will happen to public Discord servers then? Do we simply throw up our hands and admit that humanity is so awful we can&rsquo;t even have public communities anymore?</p><h5 id=the-discord-api-hates-you>The Discord API Hates You</h5><p>The rate-limits imposed on Discord API endpoints are exacerbated by temporary failures, and that&rsquo;s excluding network issues. Thus, if I attempt to set a silence role on a spammer that just joined, the API will repeatedly claim they do not exist. In fact, 3 separate API endpoints consistently fail to operate properly during a raid: A &ldquo;member joined&rdquo; event won&rsquo;t show up for several seconds, but if I fall back to calling <code>GetMember()</code>, this <em>also</em> claims the member doesn&rsquo;t exist, which means adding the role <em>also</em> fails! So I have to attempt to silence the user with every message they send until Discord actually adds the role, even though the API failures are also counted against the rate limit! This gets completely absurd once someone assaults your server with 1000 spambots, because this triggers all sorts of bottlenecks that normally aren&rsquo;t a problem. The alert telling you a user has joined? Rate limited. It&rsquo;ll take your bot 5-10 minutes to get through just <em>telling</em> you such a gigantic spambot army joined, unless you include code specifically designed to detect these situations and reduce the number of alerts. Because of this, a single user can trigger something like 5-6 API requests, all of which are counted against your global rate limit and can severely cripple a bot.</p><p>The general advice that is usually given here is &ldquo;just ban them&rdquo;, which is terrible advice because Discord&rsquo;s own awful message handling makes it incredibly easy to trigger a false positive. If a message fails to send, the client simply sends a completely new message, with it&rsquo;s own ID, and will continue re-sending the message until an Ack is received, at which point the user has probably send 3 or 4 copies of the same message, each of which have the same content, but completely unique IDs and timestamps, which looks <em>completely identical</em> to a spam attack.</p><p>Technically speaking, this is done because Discord assigns snowflake IDs server-side, so each message attempt sent by the client must have a unique snowflake assigned after it is sent. However, it can also be trivially fixed by adding an optional &ldquo;client ID&rdquo; field to the message, with a client-generated ID that stays the same if the message is resent due to a network failure. That way, the server (or the other clients) can simply drop any duplicate messages with identical client IDs while still ensuring all messages have unique IDs across their distributed cluster. This would single-handedly fix all duplicate messages across the entire platform, and eliminate almost every single false-positive I&rsquo;ve seen in my anti-spam bot.</p><h5 id=discord-doesnt-care>Discord Doesn&rsquo;t Care</h5><p>Sadly, Discord doesn&rsquo;t seem to care. The general advice in response to &ldquo;how do I defend against a large scale spam attack&rdquo; is &ldquo;just report them to us&rdquo;, so we did exactly that, and then got what has to be one of the dumbest customer service e-mails I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:571px><a href=/img/res4.PNG target=_blank><img src=/img/res4.PNG alt="Discord Being Stupid" width=100%></a></div><p>Excuse me, <em><strong>WHAT?!</strong></em> Sorry about somebody spamming your service with horrifying gore images, but please don&rsquo;t delete them! What happens if the spammers just delete the messages themselves? What happens if they send <em>child porn?</em> &ldquo;Sorry guys, please ignore the images that are literally illegal to even look at, but we can&rsquo;t delete them because Discord is fucking stupid.&rdquo; Does Discord understand the concept of <em>marking messages for deletion</em> so they are viewable for a short time as evidence for law enforcement?! My anti-spam bot&rsquo;s database currently has more information than <em>Discord&rsquo;s own servers!</em> If this had involved child porn, the FBI would have had to ask <strong>me</strong> for <strong>my records</strong> because Discord would have deleted them all!</p><p>Obviously, we&rsquo;re not going to leave 500+ gore messages sitting in the chatroom while Discord&rsquo;s ass-backwards abuse team analyzes them. I just have to hope my own nuclear option can ban them quickly enough, or simply give up the entire concept of having a public Discord server.</p><p>The problem is that the armies of spambots that were once reserved for the big servers are now so easy and so trivial to make that they&rsquo;re beginning to target smaller servers, servers that don&rsquo;t have the resources or the means to deal with that kind of large scale DDoS attack. So instead, I have to fight the growing swarm alone, armed with only a crippled, rate-limited bot of my own, and hope the dragons flying overhead don&rsquo;t notice.</p><p>What the <em>fuck</em>, Discord.</p><script src=https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js></script>

This behavior can cause all sorts of mayhem, like your program just vanishing into thin air without any error messages due to a stack overflow that terminated the program without actually throwing an exception. What I didn&rsquo;t realize is that it also eats <code>assert()</code>, which makes debugging hell, because the assertion would throw, the entire user callback would immediately terminate without any stack unwinding, and then windows would just&mldr; keep going, even though the program is now in a laughably corrupt state, because only half the function executed.</p><p>While trying to find a way to fix this, I discovered that there are no less than 4 different ways windows can choose to eat exceptions from your program. I had already told the kernel to stop eating my exceptions using the following code:<pre class=language-cpp><code>HMODULE kernel32 = LoadLibraryA(&#34;kernel32.dll&#34;);   
assert(kernel32 != 0);   
tGetPolicy pGetPolicy = (tGetPolicy)GetProcAddress(kernel32, &#34;GetProcessUserModeExceptionPolicy&#34;);  
tSetPolicy pSetPolicy = (tSetPolicy)GetProcAddress(kernel32, &#34;SetProcessUserModeExceptionPolicy&#34;);   
if(pGetPolicy &amp;&amp; pSetPolicy &amp;&amp; pGetPolicy(&amp;dwFlags))  
  pSetPolicy(dwFlags &amp; \~EXCEPTION_SWALLOWING); // Turn off the filter</code></pre>However, despite this, COM itself was wrapping an entire <code>try {} catch {}</code> statement around my program, so I had to figure out how to turn that off, too. Apparently <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110120-00/?p=11713/">some genius at Microsoft</a> decided the default behavior should be to just swallow exceptions whenever they were making COM, and now they can&rsquo;t change this default behavior because it&rsquo;d break all the applications that now depend on COM eating their exceptions to run properly! So, I turned that off with this code:<pre class=language-cpp><code>CoInitialize(NULL); // do this first   
if(SUCCEEDED(CoInitializeSecurity(NULL, -1, NULL, NULL, RPC_C_AUTHN_L_VEL_PKT_PRIVACY, RPC_C_IMP_LEV_L_IMPERSONATE, NULL, EOAC_DYNAMIC_CLOAKING, NULL)))
{
  IGlobalOptions *pGlobalOptions;
  hr = CoCreateInstance(CLSID_GlobalOptions, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;pGlobalOptions));
  if(SUCCEEDED(hr))
  {
    hr = pGlobalOptions-&gt;Set(COMGLB_EXCEPTION_HANDLING, COMGLB_EXCEPTION_DONOT_HANDLE);
    pGlobalOptions-&gt;Release();
  }
}
</code></pre>There are two additional functions that could be swallowing exceptions in your program: <code>_CrtSetReportHook2</code> and <code>SetUnhandledExceptionFilter</code>, but both of these are for SEH or C++ exceptions, and I was throwing an assertion, not an exception. I was actually able to verify, by replacing the assertion <code>#define</code> with my own version, that throwing an actual C++ exception <em>did</em> crash the program&mldr; but an assertion didn&rsquo;t. Specifically, an assertion calls <code>abort()</code>, which raises <code>SIGABRT</code>, which crashes any normal program. However, it turns out that Windows was eating the abort signal, along with every other signal I attempted to raise, which is a problem, because half the library is written in C, and C obviously can&rsquo;t raise C++ exceptions. The assertion failure even showed up in the output&mldr; but didn&rsquo;t crash the program!<pre class=language-cil><code>Assertion failed!

Program: ...udio 2015\\Projects\\feathergui\\bin\\fgDirect2D_d.dll
File: fgEffectBase.cpp
Line: 20

Expression: sizeof(_constants) == sizeof(float)_(4_4 + 2)
</code></pre>No matter what I do, Windows refuses to let the assertion failure crash the program, or even trigger a breakpoint in the debugger. In fact, calling the <code>__debugbreak()</code> intrinsic, which outputs an <code>int 3</code> CPU instruction, was <em>completely ignored</em>, as if it simply didn&rsquo;t exist. The only reliable way to actually crash the program without using C++ exceptions was to do something like divide by 0, or attempt to write to a null pointer, which triggers a segfault.</p><p>Any good developer should be using assertions to verify their assumptions, so having assertions silently fail and then <em>corrupt the program</em> is even worse than ignoring they exist! Now you could have an assertion in your code that&rsquo;s firing, terminating that callback, leaving your program in a broken state, and then the next message that&rsquo;s processed blows up for strange and bizarre reasons that make no sense because they&rsquo;re impossible.</p><p>I have a hard enough time getting my programs to <em>work</em>, I didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be this hard to make them <em>crash</em>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-02-13T21:33:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/windows-wont-let-my-program-crash/>February 13, 2017 at 9:33pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/windows-wont-let-my-program-crash/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-wont-let-my-program-crash%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Windows%20Won%27t%20Let%20My%20Program%20Crash&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-wont-let-my-program-crash%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-wont-let-my-program-crash%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/directx-is-terrifying/>DirectX Is Terrifying</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>About two months ago, I got a new laptop and proceeded to load all my projects on it. Despite compiling everything fine, my graphics engine that used DirectX mysteriously crashed upon running. I immediately suspected either a configuration issue or a driver issue, but this seemed weird because my laptop had a <em>newer</em> graphics card than my desktop. Why was it crashing on <em>newer</em> hardware? Things got even more bizarre once I narrowed down the issue - it was in my shader assignment code, which hadn&rsquo;t been touched in almost 2 years. While I initially suspected a shader compilation issue, there was no such error in the logs. All the shaders compiled fine, and then&mldr; didn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>Now, if this error had also been happening on my desktop, I would have immediately started digging through my constant assignments, followed by the vertex buffers assigned to the shader, but again, all of this ran perfectly fine on my desktop. I was completely baffled as to why things weren&rsquo;t working properly. I had eliminated all possible errors I could think of that would have resulted from moving the project from my desktop to my laptop: none of the media files were missing, all the shaders compiled, all the relative paths were correct, I was using the exact same compiler as before with all the appropriate updates. I even updated drivers on both computers, but it stubbornly refused to work on the laptop while running fine on the desktop.</p><p>Then I found something that nearly made me shit my pants.<pre class=language-cpp><code>if(profile &lt;= VERTEX_SHADER_5_0 &amp;&amp; _lastVS != shader) {
  //...
} else if(profile &lt;= PIXEL_SHADER_5_0 &amp;&amp; _lastPS != shader) { 
  //...
} else if(profile &lt;= GEOMETRY_SHADER_5_0 &amp;&amp; _lastGS != shader) {
  //...
}</code></pre>Like any sane graphics engine, I do some very simple caching by keeping track of the last shader I assigned and only setting the shader if it had actually changed. These if statements, however, have a very stupid but subtle bug that took me quite a while to catch. They&rsquo;re a standard range exclusion chain that figures out what type of shader a given shader version is. If it&rsquo;s less than say, 5, it&rsquo;s a vertex shader. Otherwise, if it&rsquo;s less than 10, that this means it&rsquo;s in the range 5-10 and is a pixel shader. Otherwise, if it&rsquo;s less than 15, it must be in the range 10-15, ad infinitum. The idea is that you don&rsquo;t need to check if the value is greater than 5 because the failure of the previous statement already implies that. However, adding that cache check on the end breaks all of this, because now you could be in the range 0-5, but the cache check could fail, throwing you down to the next statement checking to see if you&rsquo;re below 10. Because you&rsquo;re in the range 0-5, you&rsquo;re of course below 10, and the cache check will ALWAYS succeed, because no vertex shader would ever be in the pixel shader cache! <strong>All my vertex shaders were being sent in to directX as pixel shaders after their initial assignment!</strong></p><p>For almost 2 years, I had been feeding DirectX <em>total bullshit</em>, and had even tested it on multiple other computers, and it had never given me a single warning, error, crash, or any indication whatsoever that my code was <strong>completely fucking broken</strong>, in either debug mode or release mode. Somehow, deep in the depths of nVidia&rsquo;s insane DirectX driver, it had managed to detect that I had just tried to assign a vertex shader to a pixel shader, and either ignored it completely, or silently fixed my catastrophic fuckup. However, my laptop had the <em>mobile</em> drivers, which for some reason did not include this failsafe, and so it actually crashed like it was supposed to.</p><p>While this was an <em>incredibly</em> stupid bug that I must have written while sleep deprived or drunk (which is impressive, because I don&rsquo;t actually drink), it was simply impossible for me to catch because it produced <em>zero errors or warnings</em>. As a result, this bug has the honor of being both the dumbest and the longest-living bug of mine, <em>ever</em>. I&rsquo;ve checked every location I know of for any indication that anything was wrong, including hooking into the debug log of directX and dumping all it&rsquo;s messages. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zero.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve heard stories about the insane bullshit nVidia&rsquo;s drivers do, but this is <strong>fucking terrifying</strong>.</p><p>Alas, there is more. I had been experimenting with direct2D as an alternative because, well, it&rsquo;s a 2D engine, right? After getting text rendering working, a change in string caching suddenly broke the entire program. It broke in a particularly bizarre way, because it seemed to just stop rendering halfway through the scene. It took almost an hour of debugging for me to finally confirm that the moment I was rendering a particular text string, the direct2D driver just <em>stopped</em>. No errors were thrown. No warnings could be found. Direct2D&rsquo;s failure state was apparently to simply make every single function call silently fail with no indication that it was failing in the first place. It didn&rsquo;t even tell me that the device was missing or that I needed to recreate it. The text render call was made and then every single subsequent call was ignored and the backbuffer was forever frozen to that half-drawn frame.</p><p>The error itself didn&rsquo;t seem to make any more sense, either. I was passing a perfectly valid string to Direct2D, but because that string originated in a <em>different DLL</em>, it apparently made Direct2D completely shit itself. Copying the string onto the stack, however, worked (which itself could only work if the original string was valid).</p><p>The cherry on top of all this is when I discovered that Direct2D&rsquo;s matrix rotation constructor takes <strong>degrees</strong>, not radians, like <em>every single other mathematical function in the standard library.</em> <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb205362(v=vs.85).aspx">Even DirectX takes radians!</a></p><p><em><strong>WHO WRITES THESE APIs?!</strong></em></p></div><hr><time
