Does it account for <em>almost</em> everyone's needs, save for a few weird outliers that you ignore because they make up 0.0001% of the population? Congratulations, your algorithm is racist! To illustrate how this happens, let's take a recent example from Facebook. My friend's message was removed for &ldquo;violating community standards&rdquo;. Now, my friend has had all sorts of ridiculous problems with Facebook, so to test my theory, I posted the exact same message on my page, and then had him report it.</p><p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:637px><a href=/img/fb1.png target=_blank><img src=/img/fb1.png width=100%></a></div><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:512px><a href=/img/fb2.png target=_blank><img src=/img/fb2.png width=100%></a></div><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:689px><a href=/img/fb3.png target=_blank><img src=/img/fb3.png width=100%></a></div></p><p>Golly gee, look at that, Facebook confirmed the message I sent does <strong>not</strong> violate community guidelines, but he's still banned for 12 hours for posting <em>the exact same thing</em>. What I suspect happened is this: Facebook has gotten mad at my friend for having a weird name multiple times, but he can't prove what his name is because he doesn't have access to his birth certificate because of family problems, <em>and</em> he thinks someone's been falsely reporting a bunch of his messages. The algorithm for determining whether or not something is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; probably took these misleading inputs, combined it with a short list of so-called &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; topics like &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;, and then decided that if anyone reported one of his messages, it was <em>probably</em> bad. On the other hand, I have a very western name and nobody reports anything I post, so either the report actually made it to a human being, or the algorithm simply decided it was probably fine.</p><p>Of course, the algorithm was wrong about my friend's message. But Facebook doesn't care. I'm sure a bunch of self-important programmers are just itching to tell me we can't deal with all the edge-cases in a commercial algorithm because it's infeasible to account for all of them. What I want to know is, have any of these engineers ever thought about <strong>who the edge-cases are?</strong> Have they ever thought about the kind of people who can't produce birth certificates, or don't have a driver's license, or have strange names <a href=https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/i-can-text-you-a-pile-of-poo-but-i-cant-write-my-name>that don't map to unicode properly</a> because they aren't western enough?</p><p>Poor people. Minorities. Immigrants. Disabled people. All these people they claim to care about, all this talk of diversity and equal opportunity and inclusive policies, and they're building algorithms that <em>by their very nature</em> will exclude those less fortunate than them. Facebook's algorithm probably doesn't even know that my friend is asian, yet it's still discriminating against him. Do you know who can follow all those rules and assumptions they make about normal people? Rich people. White people. Privileged people. These algorithms benefit those who don't need help, and disproportionately punish those who don't need any more problems.</p><p>What's truly terrifying is that <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/upshot/taxibots-sensors-and-self-driving-shuttles-a-glimpse-at-an-internet-city-in-toronto.html>Silicon Valley wants to run the world</a>, and it wants to automate everything using a bunch of inherently flawed algorithms. Algorithms that might be <em>impossible</em> to perfect, given the almost unlimited number of edge-cases that reality can come up with. In fact, as I am writing this article, Chrome doesn't recognize &ldquo;outlier&rdquo; as a word, even though <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=outlier">Google itself does</a>.</p><p>Of course, despite this, Facebook already built an algorithm that tries to detect &ldquo;toxicity&rdquo; and silences &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; opinions. Even if they could build a perfect algorithm for detecting &ldquo;bad speech&rdquo;, do these companies really think forcibly restricting free speech will accomplish anything other than improving their own self-image? A deeply cynical part of me thinks the only thing these companies actually care about is looking good. A slightly more optimistic part of me thinks a bunch of well-meaning engineers are simply being stupid.</p><p>You can't change someone's mind by punching them in the face. Punching people in the face may shut them up, but it does not change their opinion. It doesn't <em>fix</em> anything. <em>Talking</em> to them does. I'm tired of this industry hiding problems behind shiny exteriors instead of fixing them. That's what used car salesmen do, not engineers. Programming has devolved into an art of deceit, where coders hide behind pretty animations and huge frameworks that sweep all their problems under the rug, while simultaneously screwing over the people who were supposed to benefit from an &ldquo;egalitarian&rdquo; industry that seems less and less egalitarian by the day.</p><p>Either silicon valley needs to start dealing with people that don't fit in neat little boxes, or it will no longer be able to push humanity forward. If we're going to move forward as a species, we have to do it <strong>together</strong>. Launching a bunch of rich people into space doesn't accomplish anything. Curing cancer for rich people doesn't accomplish anything. Inventing immortality for rich people doesn't accomplish anything. If we're going to push humanity forward, we have to push <em>everyone</em> forward, and that means dealing with all 7 billion outliers.</p><p>I hope silicon valley doesn't drag us back to the feudal age, but I'm beginning to think <a href=https://medium.com/@ebonstorm/feudalism-and-the-algorithmic-economy-62d6c5d90646>it already has</a>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-11-01T15:26:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ignoring-outliers-creates-racist/>November 1, 2017 at 3:26pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/ignoring-outliers-creates-racist/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fignoring-outliers-creates-racist%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ignoring%20Outliers%20Creates%20Racist%20Algorithms&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fignoring-outliers-creates-racist%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fignoring-outliers-creates-racist%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/i-used-to-want-to-work-for-google/>I Used To Want To Work For Google</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>A long time ago I thought Google was this magical company that truly cared about engineering and solving problems instead of maximizing shareholder value. Then Larry Page became CEO and <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/>I realized they were not a magical unicorn</a> and lamented the fact that they had been transformed into &ldquo;just another large company&rdquo;. Several important things happened between that post and now: Microsoft got a new CEO, so I decided to give them a shot and got hired there. I quit right before Windows 10 came out because I knew it was going to be a disaster. More recently, it's become apparent that Google had gone far past simply being a behemoth unconcerned with the cries of the helpless and transformed into something outright malevolent. It's <a href=http://gizmodo.com/yes-google-uses-its-power-to-quash-ideas-it-doesn-t-li-1798646437>silenced multiple reporters</a>, <a href=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/01/05/calling-shenanigans-on-googles-windows-phone-8-maps-narrative/>blocked windows phone from accessing youtube out of spite</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html?_r=0">successfully gotten an entire group of researchers fired by threatening to pull funding</a> (<a href=https://citizensagainstmonopoly.org/>but that didn't stop them</a>).</p><p>This is <strong>evil</strong>. This is <em>horrifying</em>. This is the kind of stuff Microsoft did in the 90s that made everyone hate it so much they still have to fight against the repercussions of decisions made two decades ago because of the sheer amount of damage they did and lives they ruined. I'm at the point where I'd rather go back to Microsoft, whose primary sin at this point is mostly just being incompetent instead of outright evil, rather than Google, who is actually doing things that are fundamentally morally wrong. These are the kinds of decisions that are bald-faced abuses of power, without any possible &ldquo;good intention&rdquo; driving them. It's <strong>vile</strong>. There is no excuse.</p><p>As an ex-Microsoft employee, I can assure you that at no point did I think Microsoft was doing something <em>evil</em> while I was there. I haven't seen Microsoft do anything outright <em>evil</em> since I left, either. The few times they came close they backed off and apologized later. Microsoft didn't piss people off by being evil, it pissed people off by being <em>dumb</em>. I was approached by a Google recruiter shortly after I left and I briefly considered going to Google because I considered them vastly more competent, and I still do. However, no amount of engineering competency can make me want to work for a company that actively does things I consider morally reprehensible. This is the same reason I will never work for Facebook. I've drawn a line in the sand, and I find myself in the surprising situation of being on the opposite side of Google, and discovering that <em>Microsoft</em>, of all companies, isn't with them.</p><p>I always thought I'd be able to mostly disregard the questionable things that Google and Microsoft were doing and compare them purely on the competency of their engineers. However, it seems that Google has every intention of driving me away by doing things so utterly disgusting I could <em>never</em> work there and still be able to sleep at night. This worries me deeply, because as these companies get larger and larger, they eat up all the other sources of employment. Working at a startup that isn't one of the big 5 won't help if it gets bought out next month. One friend of mine with whom I shared many horror stories with worked at LinkedIn. He was not happy when he woke up one day to discover he now worked for the very company he had heard me complaining about. Even now, he's thinking of quitting, and not because Microsoft is evil - they're just so goddamn <em>dumb</em>.</p><p>The problem is that there aren't many other options, short of starting your own company. Google is evil, Facebook is evil, Apple is evil if you care about open hardware, Microsoft is too stupid to be evil but might at some point become evil again, and Amazon is probably evil and may or may not treat it's employees like shit depending on who you ask. Even if you don't work directly for them, you're probably using their products or services. At some point, you have to put food on the table. This is why I generally refuse to blame someone for working for an evil company because the economy punishes you for trying to stand up for your morals. It's not the workers fault, here, it's Wall Street incentivizing rotten behavior by rewarding short-term profits instead of long-term growth. A free market optimizes to a monopoly. Monopolies are bad. I don't know what people don't get about this. We're fighting over stupid shit like transgender troops or gay rights instead of just treating other human beings with decency, all the while letting rich people rob us blind as they decimate the economy. This is stupid. I would daresay it's almost more stupid than the guy at Microsoft who decided to fire all the testers.</p><p>But I guess I'll take unrelenting stupidity over <strong>retaliating against researchers for criticizing you</strong>. At least until Microsoft remembers how to be evil. Then I don't know what I'll do.</p><p>I don't know what anyone will do.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-09-05T01:04:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-used-to-want-to-work-for-google/>September 5, 2017 at 1:04am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/i-used-to-want-to-work-for-google/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;3 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-used-to-want-to-work-for-google%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20Used%20To%20Want%20To%20Work%20For%20Google&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-used-to-want-to-work-for-google%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-used-to-want-to-work-for-google%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/sexist-programmers-are-awful-engineers/>Sexist Programmers Are Awful Engineers</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Men and women <a href=https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2017spring/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different.html>are fundamentally different</a>. So are white people and black people and autistic people and gay people and transgender people and conservatives and liberals and every other human being along every imaginable axis of discrimination. Some of these differences are cultural. Others are genetic. Others depend on environmental factors. These differences mean that some of us are inherently better at certain tasks than others. On average, men are better at spatial temporal reasoning, women are better at reading comprehension and writing ability, and <a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2011/06/14/why-some-psychopaths-make-great-ceos/#749d149f261a>psychopaths can sometimes be excellent CEOs</a>.</p><p>Whenever I meet a programmer who insists on doing everything a certain way, the chances I'll hire them drop off a cliff. Just as object-oriented programming didn't fix everything, neither will functional programming, or data-oriented programming or array-based programming or any other language. They are different tools that allow you to attack a problem from different directions, much like we have different classes of algorithms to attack certain classes of problems. Greedy algorithms, lazy evaluation, dynamic programming, recursive-descent, maximum flow, all of these are different ways to approach a problem. They represent looking at a problem from <em>different perspectives</em>. A problem that is difficult from one angle might be trivial when examined from a different angle.</p><p>When I stumbled upon this <a href=http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320>anti-diversity memo written by a Google employee</a>, I wonder just how dysfunctional of an engineer that person is. Problems are never solved by being closed-minded. They are solved by opening ourselves to new possibilities and exploring the problem space as an infinitely-dimensional fabric of possible configurations. You do not find possible edge-cases by being closed-minded. You find them by probing the outer edges of your solution, trying to find singularities and inflection points that hint at unusual behavior.</p><p>You cannot build a great company by hiring people who are good at the same things you are. Attempting to maximize diversity only comes at a perceived cost of aptitude if you are measuring the wrong things. If your concept of what makes a &ldquo;good programmer&rdquo; is an extremely narrow set of skills, then you will inevitably select towards a specific ethnicity, culture, or sex, because the tiny statistical differences will be grossly magnified by the extremely narrow job requirements. Demand that all your programmers invert a binary tree on a whiteboard and you'll filter out <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?lang=en">the guy who wrote the software 90% of your company uses</a>.</p><p>If you think the field of computer science is really this narrow, you're a terrible programmer. Turing completeness is a fundamental property of the universe, and we are only just beginning to explore the full implications of information theory, the foundations of type theory, NP-completeness, and the nature of computation itself. Disregarding other people because they can't do something without ever considering what they can do will only hurt your team, and your company. Diversity inclusion programs shouldn't try to hire more women and ethnic groups because they're the same, they should be trying to hire them <em>because they are different</em>.</p><p>When hiring someone to complete a job, you should hire whoever is the best fit for the job. In a vacuum where there is a single task that needs to be completed, gender and ethnicity should be ignored in favor of a purely meritocratic assessment. However, if you have a company that must respond to a changing world, diversity can reveal solutions you never even knew existed. An established company like Google must actively seek to increase diversity so that it can explore new perspectives that may give it an edge over its rivals. They cannot select on a purely meritocratic basis, because all measures of merit would be based on what the company is <em>already good at</em>, not what it could be good at. You cannot explore new opportunities by hiring the same people.</p><p>Intelligent people value feedback from people who think differently than them. This is why many executives will deliberately hire people they disagree with so they can have someone challenge their views. This helps avoid creating an echo-chamber, which is the ultimate irony of a memo that's called &ldquo;Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber&rdquo;, because scrapping the diversity inclusion programs as the memo suggests would itself create a new echo-chamber. You can't remove an echo-chamber by removing diversity - the author's premise is self-defeating. If they had stuck with only claiming that conservative ideologies should not be discriminated against, they would have been correct. Unfortunately, telling everyone they shouldn't discriminate against your perspective, which itself involves discriminating against other perspectives, is by definition a contradiction.</p><p>We aren't going to write better programs by doing the same thing we've been doing for the past 10 years. To improve is to change, and those who seek to become better software engineers must themselves embrace change, or they will be left behind to rot in the sewers of forgotten programs, maintaining rancid enterprise code for the rest of their lives. If we are unwilling to change who is writing the programs, we'll be stuck making the same thing over and over again. A business that thinks nothing needs to change is one ripe for disruption. If you really think only hiring white males who correctly answer all your questions about graph theory and B-trees will help your business in the long-term, you're an idiot.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-08-06T12:20:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/sexist-programmers-are-awful-engineers/>August 6, 2017 at 12:20pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/sexist-programmers-are-awful-engineers/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fsexist-programmers-are-awful-engineers%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Sexist%20Programmers%20Are%20Awful%20Engineers&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fsexist-programmers-are-awful-engineers%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fsexist-programmers-are-awful-engineers%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/why-i-never-built-my-soundcloud-killer/>Why I Never Built My SoundCloud Killer</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>While the news of SoundCloud imploding are fairly recent, musicians and producers have had a beef with the music uploading site's direction for years. I still remember when SoundCloud only gave you a paltry 2 hours worth of free upload time and managed to convert my high quality lossless WAV files to the shittiest 128 kbps MP3 I've ever heard in my life. What really pissed me off was that they demanded a ridiculous $7 a month just to <em>double</em> your upload time. This is in contrast to <a href=http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/>Newgrounds</a>, a tiny website run by a dozen people with an audio portal built almost as an afterthought that still manages to be superior to <em>every single other offering</em>. It gives you unlimited space, for free, and lets you upload <em>your own MP3</em>, which allows me to upload properly encoded joint-stereo 128 kbps MP3 files, or much higher quality MP3s for songs I'm giving out for free.</p><p>Obviously, Newgrounds is only able to offer unlimited free uploads because the audio portal just piggybacks on the rest of the site. However, I was so pissed off at SoundCloud's disgusting subscription offering that I actually ran the numbers in terms of what it would cost to store lossless FLAC encodings of songs using Amazon S3. These calculations are now out of date, so I've redone them for the purposes of this blog.</p><p>The average size of an FLAC encoded song is around 60 MB, but we'll assume it's 80 MB as an upper-bound, and to include the cost of storing the joint-stereo 128 kbps streaming MP3, which is usually less than 10% the size (using OPUS would reduce this even more, but it is not supported on all browsers yet). Amazon offers the first 50 TB of storage at $0.023 per gigabyte, per month. This comes down to about $0.00184 per month, per song, in order to store the full uncompressed version. Now, obviously, we must also stream the song, but we're only streaming the low-quality version, which is 10% the size, which is about 7 MB in our example (7 MB + 70 MB is about 80 MB for storage). The vast majority of music producers on the website have almost no following, and most will be lucky to get a single viral hit. As an example, after being on SoundCloud for over 7 years, I have managed to amass a mere 100000 views <em>total</em>. If I somehow got 20000 views of my songs <em>every single month</em>, the total cost of streaming 140 GB from Amazon S3 at $0.05 per GB would be $7 per month. That's how much SoundCloud is charging just to double my storage space!</p><p>This makes even less sense when you calculate that 6 hours of FLAC would be 4.7 GB, or about 5 GB including the 128 kbps streaming MP3s. 5 GB of <em>storage space</em> costs a pathetic <strong>$0.12 cents a month</strong> to store on Amazon S3! All of the costs come down to <em>bandwidth</em>, which is relatively fixed by how many people are listening to songs, not how many songs there are. This means, if I'm paying any music service for the right to store music on their servers, I should get <em>near unlimited storage space</em> (maybe put in a sanity check of 10 GB max per month to limit abuse). I will point out that <a href=https://clyp.it/premium-pricing>Clyp.it actually does this properly</a>, giving you 6 hours of storage space for free and unlimited storage space if you pay them $6 a month.</p><p>Unfortunately, Clyp.it does not try to be SoundCloud as it has no comments, no reshares, and well, not much of anything, really. It's like a giant pastebin for sounds where you can follow people or favorite things. <strong>It's also probably screwed.</strong></p><p>Even though I had a name and a website design, I never launched it because even if I could find a way to identify a copyrighted song via some sort of ContentID system, I couldn't make it work without the record industry's cooperation. The problem is that the system has to know what songs are illegal in order to block them in the first place. Otherwise, people could upload Justin Bieber songs with impunity and I'd still get sued out of existence. The hard part about making a site like SoundCloud isn't actually making the website, it's dealing with the insane, litigation-happy oligarchs that own the entire music industry.</p><p>SoundCloud's ordeal is <a href=https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/inside-the-storm-at-soundcloud>mentioned in this article</a>. Surprisingly, it took until 2012 for them to realize they had to start making deals with the major music labels. It took until 2014 for many of those deals to actually happen, and they were not in SoundCloud's favor. A deal with Warner Music Group, closed in 2014, gave Warner a <strong>3-5% stake in the company</strong> and an undisclosed cut of ad-revenue, just so SoundCloud could have the privilege of <em>not being sued out of existence</em>. This wasn't even an investment round, it was just so SoundCloud could have Warner Music Group's catalog on the site and not get sued!</p><p>At this point, you have to be either very naive or very rich to go up against an industry that can and will send an army of lawyers after you. The legal system is not in your favor. It will be used to crush you like a bug and there is nothing you can do about it, because of one fundamental problem: <strong>You can't detect copyright infringement without access to the original copy</strong>.</p><p>Because of this, the music industry holds the entire world hostage with a kind of Catch-22: They demand you take down all copyright infringing material, but in order to figure out if something is copyright infringement, you need access to <em>their</em> songs, which they only give out on <em>their</em> terms, which are never in your favor.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-07-30T16:57:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-i-never-built-my-soundcloud-killer/>July 30, 2017 at 4:57pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/why-i-never-built-my-soundcloud-killer/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;3 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-i-never-built-my-soundcloud-killer%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why%20I%20Never%20Built%20My%20SoundCloud%20Killer&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-i-never-built-my-soundcloud-killer%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-i-never-built-my-soundcloud-killer%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/integrating-luajit-and-autogenerating-c/>Integrating LuaJIT and Autogenerating C Bindings In Visual Studio</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p><a href=https://www.lua.org/>Lua</a> is a popular scripting language due to its tight integration with C. <a href=http://luajit.org/>LuaJIT</a> is an extremely fast JIT compiler for Lua that can be integrated into your game, which also provides an <a href=http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html>FFI Library</a> that directly interfaces with C functions, eliminating most overhead. However, the FFI library only accepts a subset of the C standard. Specifically, <strong>&ldquo;C declarations are not passed through a C pre-processor, yet. No pre-processor tokens are allowed, except for #pragma pack."</strong> The website suggests running the header file through a preprocesser stage, but I have yet to find a LuaJIT tutorial that actually explains how to do this. Instead, all the examples simply copy+paste the function prototype into the Lua file itself. Doing this with makefiles and GCC is trivial, because you just have to add a compile step using the <code>-E</code> option, but integrating this with Visual Studio is more difficult. In addition, I'll show you how to properly load scripts and modify the PATH lookup variable so your game can have a proper <code>scripts</code> folder instead of dumping everything in <code>bin</code>.</p><h5 id=compilation>Compilation</h5><p>To begin, we need to <a href=http://luajit.org/download.html>download LuaJIT</a> and get it to actually compile. Doing this manually isn't too difficult, simply open an x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (or x86 Native Tools if you want 32-bit), navigate to <code>src/msvcbuild.bat</code> and run <code>msvcbuild.bat</code>. The default options will build an x64 or x86 dll with dynamic linking to the CRT. If you want a static lib file, you need to run it with the <code>static</code> option. If you want static linking to the CRT so you don't have to deal with that annoying Visual Studio Runtime Library crap, you'll have to modify the .bat file directly. Specifically, you need to find <code>%LJCOMPILE% /MD</code> and change it to <code>%LJCOMPILE% /MT</code>. This will then compile the static lib or dll with static CRT linking to match your other projects.</p><p>This is a bit of a pain, and recently I've been trying to automate my build process and dependencies using <a href=https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg>vcpkg</a> to act as a C++ package manager. A port of LuaJIT is included in the latest update of vcpkg, but if you want one that always statically links to the CRT, you can <a href=https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/luajit>get it here</a>.</p><p>An important note: the build instructions for LuaJIT state that you should copy the lua scripts contained in <code>src/jit</code> to your application folder. What it doesn't mention is that this is <em>optional</em> - those scripts contain debugging instructions for the JIT engine, which you probably don't need. It will work just fine without them.</p><p>Once you have LuaJIT built, you should add it's library file to your project. This library file is called <strong>lua51.lib</strong> (and the dll is <strong>lua51.dll</strong>), because LuaJIT is designed as a drop-in replacement for the default Lua runtime. Now we need to actually load Lua in our program and integrate it with our code. To do this, use <code>lua_open()</code>, which returns a <code>lua_State*</code> pointer. You will need that <code>lua_State*</code> pointer for everything else you do, so store it somewhere easy to get to. If you are building a game using an Entity Component System, it makes sense to build a <code>LuaSystem</code> that stores your <code>lua_State*</code> pointer.</p><h5 id=initialization>Initialization</h5><p>The next step is to load in all the standard Lua libraries using <code>luaL_openlibs(L)</code>. Normally, you shouldn't do this if you need script sandboxing for player-created scripts. However, <strong>LuaJIT's FFI library is inherently unsafe</strong>. Any script with access to the FFI library can call any kernel API it wants, so you should be extremely careful about using LuaJIT if this is a use-case for your game. We can also register any C functions we want to the old-fashioned way via <code>lua_register</code>, but this is only useful for functions that don't have C analogues (due to having multiple return values, etc).</p><p>There is one function in particular that you probably want to overload, and that is the <code>print()</code> function. By default, Lua will simply print to standard out, but if you aren't redirecting standard out to your in-game console, you probably have your own <code>std::ostream</code> (or even a custom stream class) that is sent all log messages. By overloading <code>print()</code>, we can have our Lua scripts automatically write to both our log file and our in-game console, which is extremely useful. Here is a complete re-implementation of <code>print</code> that outputs to an arbitrary <code>std::ostream&</code> object:<pre class=language-cpp><code>int PrintOut(lua_State *L, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  int n = lua_gettop(L);  /* number of arguments */
  if(!n)
    return 0;
  int i;
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;tostring&#34;);
  for(i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
  {
    const char *s;
    lua_pushvalue(L, -1);  /* function to be called */
    lua_pushvalue(L, i);   /* value to print */
    lua_call(L, 1, 1);
    s = lua_tostring(L, -1);  /* get result */
    if(s == NULL)
      return luaL_error(L, LUA_QL(&#34;tostring&#34;) &#34; must return a string to &#34;
        LUA_QL(&#34;print&#34;));
    if(i &gt; 1) out &lt;&lt; &#34;\t&#34;;
    out &lt;&lt; s;
    lua_pop(L, 1);  /* pop result */
  }
  out &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>To overwrite the existing <code>print</code> function, we need to first define a Lua compatible shim function. In this example, I pass <code>std::cout</code> as the target stream:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int lua_Print(lua_State *L)
{
  return PrintOut(L, std::cout);
}
</code></pre>Now we simply register our <code>lua_Print</code> function using <code>lua_register(L, "print", &lua_Print)</code>. If we were doing this in a <code>LuaSystem</code> object, our constructor would look like this:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>LuaSystem::LuaSystem()
{
  L = lua_open();
  luaL_openlibs(L);
  lua_register(L, &#34;print&#34;, &amp;lua_Print);
}
</code></pre>To clean up our Lua instance, we need to both trigger a final GC iteration to clean up any dangling memory, and then we call <code>lua_close(L)</code>, so our destructor would look like this:<pre class=language-cpp><code>LuaSystem::~LuaSystem()
{
  lua_gc(L, LUA_GCCOLLECT, 0);
  lua_close(L);
  L = 0;
}
</code></pre></p><h5 id=loadings-scripts-via-require>Loadings Scripts via Require</h5><p>At this point most tutorials skip to the part where you load a Lua script and write &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;, but we aren't done yet. Integrating Lua into your game means loading scripts and/or arbitrary strings as Lua code while properly resolving dependencies. If you don't do this, any one of your scripts that relies on another script will have to do <code>require("full/path/to/script.lua")</code>. We also face another problem - if we want to have a <code>scripts</code> folder where we simply automatically load every single script into our workspace, simply loading them all can cause duplicated code, because <code>luaL_loadfile</code> does <em>not</em> have any knowledge of <code>require</code>. You can solve this by simply loading a single <code>bootstrap.lua</code> script which then loads all your game's scripts via <code>require</code>, but we're going to build a much more robust solution.</p><p>First, we need to modify Lua's <code>PATH</code> variable, or the variable that controls where it looks up scripts relative to our current directory. This function will append a path (which should be of the form <code>"path/to/scripts/?.lua"</code>) to the beginning of the <code>PATH</code> variable, giving it highest priority, which you can then use to add as many <code>script</code> directories as you want in your game, and any lua script from any of those folders will then be able to <code>require()</code> a script from any other folder in <code>PATH</code> without a problem. Obviously, you should probably only add one or two folders, because you don't want to deal with potential name conflicts in your script files.<pre class=language-cpp><code>int AppendPath(lua_State *L, const char* path)
{
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;package&#34;);
  lua_getfield(L, -1, &#34;path&#34;); // get field &#34;path&#34; from table at top of stack (-1)
  std::string npath = path;
  npath.append(&#34;;&#34;);
  npath.append(lua_tostring(L, -1)); // grab path string from top of stack
  lua_pop(L, 1);
  lua_pushstring(L, npath.c_str());
  lua_setfield(L, -2, &#34;path&#34;); // set the field &#34;path&#34; in table at -2 with value at top of stack
  lua_pop(L, 1); // get rid of package table from top of stack
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>Next, we need a way to load all of our scripts using <code>require()</code> so that Lua properly resolves the dependencies. To do this, we create a function in C that literally calls the <code>require()</code> function for us:<pre class=language-cpp><code>int Require(lua_State *L,const char *name)
{
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;require&#34;);
  lua_pushstring(L, name);
  int r = lua_pcall(L, 1, 1, 0);
  if(!r)
    lua_pop(L, 1);
  WriteError(L, r, std::cout);
  return r;
}
</code></pre>By using this to load all our scripts, we don't have to worry about loading them in any particular order - <code>require</code> will ensure everything gets loaded correctly. An important note here is <code>WriteError()</code>, which is a generic error handling function that processes Lua errors and writes them to a log. All errors in lua will return a nonzero error code, and will <em>usually</em> push a string containing the error message to the stack, which must then be popped off, or it'll mess things up later.<pre class=language-cpp><code>void WriteError(lua_State *L, int r, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  if(!r)
    return;
  if(!lua_isnil(L, -1)) // Check if a string was pushed

</code></pre></p><h5 id=automatic-c-binding-generation>Automatic C Binding Generation</h5><p>Fantastic, now we're all set to load up our scripts, but we still need to somehow define a header file and also load that header file into LuaJIT's FFI library so our scripts have direct access to our program's exposed C functions. One way to do this is to just copy+paste your C function definitions into a Lua file in your scripts folder that is then automatically loaded. This, however, is a pain in the butt and is error-prone. We want to have a <em>single source of truth</em> for our function definitions, which means defining our entire LuaJIT C API in a single header file, which is then loaded directly into LuaJIT. Predictably, we will accomplish this by abusing the C preprocessor:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>#ifndef __LUA_API_H__
#define __LUA_API_H__

#ifndef LUA_EXPORTS
#define LUAFUNC(ret, name, ...) ffi.cdef[[ ret lua_##name(__VA_ARGS__); ]]; name = ffi.C.lua_##name
local ffi = require(&#34;ffi&#34;)
ffi.cdef[[ // Initial struct definitions
#else
#define LUAFUNC(ret, name, ...) ret __declspec(dllexport) lua_##name(__VA_ARGS__)
extern &#34;C&#34; { // Ensure C linkage is being used
#endif

struct GameInfo
{
  uint64_t DashTail;
  uint64_t MaxDash;
};

typedef const char* CSTRING; // VC++ complains about having const char* in macros, so we typedef it here

#ifndef LUA_EXPORTS
]] // End struct definitions
#endif

  LUAFUNC(CSTRING, GetGameName);
  LUAFUNC(CSTRING, IntToString, int);
  LUAFUNC(void, setdeadzone, float);

#ifdef Everglade_EXPORTS
}
#endif

#endif
</code></pre>The key idea here is to use macros such that, when we pass this through the preprocessor <em>without</em> any predefined constants, it will magically turn into a valid Lua script. However, when we compile it in our C++ project, our project defines <code>LUA_EXPORTS</code>, and the result is a valid C header. Our C <code>LUAFUNC</code> is set up so that we're using C linkage for our structs and functions, and that we're <em>exporting the function</em> via <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code>. This obviously only works for Visual Studio so you'll want to set up a macro for the GCC version, but I will warn you that VC++ got really cranky when i tried to use a macro for that in my code, so you may end up having to redefine the entire <code>LUAFUNC</code> macro for each compiler.</p><p>At this point, we have a bit of a choice to make. It's more convenient to have the C functions available in the global namespace, which is what this script does, because this simplifies calling them from an interactive console. However, <strong>using <code>ffi.C.FunctionName</code> is significantly faster</strong>. Technically the fastest way is declaring <code>local C = ffi.C</code> at the top of a file and then calling the functions via <code>C.FunctionName</code>. Luckily, importing the functions into the global namespace does not preclude us from using the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; way of calling them, so our script here imports them into the global namespace for ease of use, but in our scripts we can use the <code>C.FunctionName</code> method instead. Thus, when outputting our Lua script, our <code>LUAFUNC</code> macro wraps our function definition in a LuaJIT <code>ffi.cdef</code> block, and then runs a <em>second</em> Lua statement that brings the function into the global namespace. This is why we have an initial <code>ffi.cdef</code> code block for the structs up top, so we can include that second lua statement after each function definition.</p><p>Now we need to set up our compilation so that Visual Studio generates this file without any predefined constants and outputs the resulting lua script to our <code>scripts</code> folder, where our other in-game scripts can automatically load it from. We can accomplish this using a Post-Build Event (under Configuration Properties -> Build Events -> Post-Build Event), which then runs the following code:<pre class=language-cil><code>CL LuaAPI.h /P /EP /u
COPY &#34;LuaAPI.i&#34; &#34;../bin/your/script/folder/LuaAPI.lua&#34; /Y
</code></pre>Visual Studio can sometimes be finicky about that newline, but if you put in two statements on two separate lines, it should run both commands sequentially. You may have to edit the project file directly to convince it to actually do this. The key line here is <code>CL LuaAPI.h /P /EP /u</code>, which tells the compiler to preprocess the file and output it to a <code>*.i</code> file. There is no option to configure the output file, it will always be the exact same file but with a <code>.i</code> extension, so we have to copy and rename it ourselves to our scripts folder using the <code>COPY</code> command.</p><h5 id=loading-and-calling-lua-code>Loading and Calling Lua Code</h5><p>We are now set to load all our lua scripts in our script folder via <code>Require</code>, but what if we want an interactive Lua console? There are lua functions that read strings, but to make this simpler, I will provide a function that loads a lua script from an arbitrary <code>std::istream</code> and outputs to an arbitrary <code>std::ostream</code>:<pre class=language-cpp><code>const char* _luaStreamReader(lua_State *L, void *data, size_t *size)
{
  static char buf[CHUNKSIZE];
  reinterpret_cast&lt;std::istream*&gt;(data)-&gt;read(buf, CHUNKSIZE);
  *size = reinterpret_cast&lt;std::istream*&gt;(data)-&gt;gcount();
  return buf;
}

int Load(lua_State *L, std::istream&amp; s, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  int r = lua_load(L, &amp;_luaStreamReader, &amp;s, 0);

  if(!r)
  {
    r = lua_pcall(L, 0, LUA_MULTRET, 0);
    if(!r)
      PrintOut(L, out);
  }

  WriteError(L, r, out);
  return r;
}
</code></pre>Of course, the other question is how to call Lua functions from our C++ code directly. There are many, <em>many</em> different implementations of this available, of varying amounts of safety and completeness, but to get you started, here is a very simple implementation in C++ using templates. Note that this does not handle errors - you can change it to use <code>lua_pcall</code> and check the return code, but <a href=http://www.knightsgame.org.uk/blog/2012/09/03/notes-on-luac-error-handling/>handling arbitrary Lua errors is nontrivial</a>.<pre class=language-cpp><code>template&lt;class T, int N&gt;
