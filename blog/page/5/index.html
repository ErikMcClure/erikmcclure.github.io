Does it account for <em>almost</em> everyone&rsquo;s needs, save for a few weird outliers that you ignore because they make up 0.0001% of the population? Congratulations, your algorithm is racist! To illustrate how this happens, let&rsquo;s take a recent example from Facebook. My friend&rsquo;s message was removed for &ldquo;violating community standards&rdquo;. Now, my friend has had all sorts of ridiculous problems with Facebook, so to test my theory, I posted the exact same message on my page, and then had him report it.</p><p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:637px><a href=/img/fb1.png target=_blank><img src=/img/fb1.png width=100%></a></div><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:512px><a href=/img/fb2.png target=_blank><img src=/img/fb2.png width=100%></a></div><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:689px><a href=/img/fb3.png target=_blank><img src=/img/fb3.png width=100%></a></div></p><p>Golly gee, look at that, Facebook confirmed the message I sent does <strong>not</strong> violate community guidelines, but he&rsquo;s still banned for 12 hours for posting <em>the exact same thing</em>. What I suspect happened is this: Facebook has gotten mad at my friend for having a weird name multiple times, but he can&rsquo;t prove what his name is because he doesn&rsquo;t have access to his birth certificate because of family problems, <em>and</em> he thinks someone&rsquo;s been falsely reporting a bunch of his messages. The algorithm for determining whether or not something is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; probably took these misleading inputs, combined it with a short list of so-called &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; topics like &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;, and then decided that if anyone reported one of his messages, it was <em>probably</em> bad. On the other hand, I have a very western name and nobody reports anything I post, so either the report actually made it to a human being, or the algorithm simply decided it was probably fine.</p><p>Of course, the algorithm was wrong about my friend&rsquo;s message. But Facebook doesn&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m sure a bunch of self-important programmers are just itching to tell me we can&rsquo;t deal with all the edge-cases in a commercial algorithm because it&rsquo;s infeasible to account for all of them. What I want to know is, have any of these engineers ever thought about <strong>who the edge-cases are?</strong> Have they ever thought about the kind of people who can&rsquo;t produce birth certificates, or don&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s license, or have strange names <a href=https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/i-can-text-you-a-pile-of-poo-but-i-cant-write-my-name>that don&rsquo;t map to unicode properly</a> because they aren&rsquo;t western enough?</p><p>Poor people. Minorities. Immigrants. Disabled people. All these people they claim to care about, all this talk of diversity and equal opportunity and inclusive policies, and they&rsquo;re building algorithms that <em>by their very nature</em> will exclude those less fortunate than them. Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm probably doesn&rsquo;t even know that my friend is asian, yet it&rsquo;s still discriminating against him. Do you know who can follow all those rules and assumptions they make about normal people? Rich people. White people. Privileged people. These algorithms benefit those who don&rsquo;t need help, and disproportionately punish those who don&rsquo;t need any more problems.</p><p>What&rsquo;s truly terrifying is that <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/upshot/taxibots-sensors-and-self-driving-shuttles-a-glimpse-at-an-internet-city-in-toronto.html>Silicon Valley wants to run the world</a>, and it wants to automate everything using a bunch of inherently flawed algorithms. Algorithms that might be <em>impossible</em> to perfect, given the almost unlimited number of edge-cases that reality can come up with. In fact, as I am writing this article, Chrome doesn&rsquo;t recognize &ldquo;outlier&rdquo; as a word, even though <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=outlier">Google itself does</a>.</p><p>Of course, despite this, Facebook already built an algorithm that tries to detect &ldquo;toxicity&rdquo; and silences &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; opinions. Even if they could build a perfect algorithm for detecting &ldquo;bad speech&rdquo;, do these companies really think forcibly restricting free speech will accomplish anything other than improving their own self-image? A deeply cynical part of me thinks the only thing these companies actually care about is looking good. A slightly more optimistic part of me thinks a bunch of well-meaning engineers are simply being stupid.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t change someone&rsquo;s mind by punching them in the face. Punching people in the face may shut them up, but it does not change their opinion. It doesn&rsquo;t <em>fix</em> anything. <em>Talking</em> to them does. I&rsquo;m tired of this industry hiding problems behind shiny exteriors instead of fixing them. That&rsquo;s what used car salesmen do, not engineers. Programming has devolved into an art of deceit, where coders hide behind pretty animations and huge frameworks that sweep all their problems under the rug, while simultaneously screwing over the people who were supposed to benefit from an &ldquo;egalitarian&rdquo; industry that seems less and less egalitarian by the day.</p><p>Either silicon valley needs to start dealing with people that don&rsquo;t fit in neat little boxes, or it will no longer be able to push humanity forward. If we&rsquo;re going to move forward as a species, we have to do it <strong>together</strong>. Launching a bunch of rich people into space doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything. Curing cancer for rich people doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything. Inventing immortality for rich people doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything. If we&rsquo;re going to push humanity forward, we have to push <em>everyone</em> forward, and that means dealing with all 7 billion outliers.</p><p>I hope silicon valley doesn&rsquo;t drag us back to the feudal age, but I&rsquo;m beginning to think <a href=https://medium.com/@ebonstorm/feudalism-and-the-algorithmic-economy-62d6c5d90646>it already has</a>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-11-01T15:26:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ignoring-outliers-creates-racist/>November 1, 2017 at 3:26pm</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/ignoring-outliers-creates-racist/#commento> comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fignoring-outliers-creates-racist%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ignoring%20Outliers%20Creates%20Racist%20Algorithms&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fignoring-outliers-creates-racist%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fignoring-outliers-creates-racist%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/i-used-to-want-to-work-for-google/>I Used To Want To Work For Google</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>A long time ago I thought Google was this magical company that truly cared about engineering and solving problems instead of maximizing shareholder value. Then Larry Page became CEO and <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/>I realized they were not a magical unicorn</a> and lamented the fact that they had been transformed into &ldquo;just another large company&rdquo;. Several important things happened between that post and now: Microsoft got a new CEO, so I decided to give them a shot and got hired there. I quit right before Windows 10 came out because I knew it was going to be a disaster. More recently, it&rsquo;s become apparent that Google had gone far past simply being a behemoth unconcerned with the cries of the helpless and transformed into something outright malevolent. It&rsquo;s <a href=http://gizmodo.com/yes-google-uses-its-power-to-quash-ideas-it-doesn-t-li-1798646437>silenced multiple reporters</a>, <a href=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/01/05/calling-shenanigans-on-googles-windows-phone-8-maps-narrative/>blocked windows phone from accessing youtube out of spite</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html?_r=0">successfully gotten an entire group of researchers fired by threatening to pull funding</a> (<a href=https://citizensagainstmonopoly.org/>but that didn&rsquo;t stop them</a>).</p><p>This is <strong>evil</strong>. This is <em>horrifying</em>. This is the kind of stuff Microsoft did in the 90s that made everyone hate it so much they still have to fight against the repercussions of decisions made two decades ago because of the sheer amount of damage they did and lives they ruined. I&rsquo;m at the point where I&rsquo;d rather go back to Microsoft, whose primary sin at this point is mostly just being incompetent instead of outright evil, rather than Google, who is actually doing things that are fundamentally morally wrong. These are the kinds of decisions that are bald-faced abuses of power, without any possible &ldquo;good intention&rdquo; driving them. It&rsquo;s <strong>vile</strong>. There is no excuse.</p><p>As an ex-Microsoft employee, I can assure you that at no point did I think Microsoft was doing something <em>evil</em> while I was there. I haven&rsquo;t seen Microsoft do anything outright <em>evil</em> since I left, either. The few times they came close they backed off and apologized later. Microsoft didn&rsquo;t piss people off by being evil, it pissed people off by being <em>dumb</em>. I was approached by a Google recruiter shortly after I left and I briefly considered going to Google because I considered them vastly more competent, and I still do. However, no amount of engineering competency can make me want to work for a company that actively does things I consider morally reprehensible. This is the same reason I will never work for Facebook. I&rsquo;ve drawn a line in the sand, and I find myself in the surprising situation of being on the opposite side of Google, and discovering that <em>Microsoft</em>, of all companies, isn&rsquo;t with them.</p><p>I always thought I&rsquo;d be able to mostly disregard the questionable things that Google and Microsoft were doing and compare them purely on the competency of their engineers. However, it seems that Google has every intention of driving me away by doing things so utterly disgusting I could <em>never</em> work there and still be able to sleep at night. This worries me deeply, because as these companies get larger and larger, they eat up all the other sources of employment. Working at a startup that isn&rsquo;t one of the big 5 won&rsquo;t help if it gets bought out next month. One friend of mine with whom I shared many horror stories with worked at LinkedIn. He was not happy when he woke up one day to discover he now worked for the very company he had heard me complaining about. Even now, he&rsquo;s thinking of quitting, and not because Microsoft is evil - they&rsquo;re just so goddamn <em>dumb</em>.</p><p>The problem is that there aren&rsquo;t many other options, short of starting your own company. Google is evil, Facebook is evil, Apple is evil if you care about open hardware, Microsoft is too stupid to be evil but might at some point become evil again, and Amazon is probably evil and may or may not treat it&rsquo;s employees like shit depending on who you ask. Even if you don&rsquo;t work directly for them, you&rsquo;re probably using their products or services. At some point, you have to put food on the table. This is why I generally refuse to blame someone for working for an evil company because the economy punishes you for trying to stand up for your morals. It&rsquo;s not the workers fault, here, it&rsquo;s Wall Street incentivizing rotten behavior by rewarding short-term profits instead of long-term growth. A free market optimizes to a monopoly. Monopolies are bad. I don&rsquo;t know what people don&rsquo;t get about this. We&rsquo;re fighting over stupid shit like transgender troops or gay rights instead of just treating other human beings with decency, all the while letting rich people rob us blind as they decimate the economy. This is stupid. I would daresay it&rsquo;s almost more stupid than the guy at Microsoft who decided to fire all the testers.</p><p>But I guess I&rsquo;ll take unrelenting stupidity over <strong>retaliating against researchers for criticizing you</strong>. At least until Microsoft remembers how to be evil. Then I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what anyone will do.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-09-05T01:04:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-used-to-want-to-work-for-google/>September 5, 2017 at 1:04am</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/i-used-to-want-to-work-for-google/#commento>3 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-used-to-want-to-work-for-google%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20Used%20To%20Want%20To%20Work%20For%20Google&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-used-to-want-to-work-for-google%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fi-used-to-want-to-work-for-google%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/integrating-luajit-and-autogenerating-c/>Integrating LuaJIT and Autogenerating C Bindings In Visual Studio</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p><a href=https://www.lua.org/>Lua</a> is a popular scripting language due to its tight integration with C. <a href=http://luajit.org/>LuaJIT</a> is an extremely fast JIT compiler for Lua that can be integrated into your game, which also provides an <a href=http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html>FFI Library</a> that directly interfaces with C functions, eliminating most overhead. However, the FFI library only accepts a subset of the C standard. Specifically, <strong>&ldquo;C declarations are not passed through a C pre-processor, yet. No pre-processor tokens are allowed, except for #pragma pack.&rdquo;</strong> The website suggests running the header file through a preprocesser stage, but I have yet to find a LuaJIT tutorial that actually explains how to do this. Instead, all the examples simply copy+paste the function prototype into the Lua file itself. Doing this with makefiles and GCC is trivial, because you just have to add a compile step using <a href=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.1/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html>the <code>-E</code> option</a>, but integrating this with Visual Studio is more difficult. In addition, I&rsquo;ll show you how to properly load scripts and modify the PATH lookup variable so your game can have a proper <code>scripts</code> folder instead of dumping everything in <code>bin</code>.</p><h5 id=compilation>Compilation</h5><p>To begin, we need to <a href=http://luajit.org/download.html>download LuaJIT</a> and get it to actually compile. Doing this manually isn&rsquo;t too difficult, simply open an x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (or x86 Native Tools if you want 32-bit), navigate to <code>src/msvcbuild.bat</code> and run <code>msvcbuild.bat</code>. The default options will build an x64 or x86 dll with dynamic linking to the CRT. If you want a static lib file, you need to run it with the <code>static</code> option. If you want static linking to the CRT so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with that annoying Visual Studio Runtime Library crap, you&rsquo;ll have to modify the .bat file directly. Specifically, you need to find <code>%LJCOMPILE% /MD</code> and change it to <code>%LJCOMPILE% /MT</code>. This will then compile the static lib or dll with static CRT linking to match your other projects.</p><p>This is a bit of a pain, and recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to automate my build process and dependencies using <a href=https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg>vcpkg</a> to act as a C++ package manager. A port of LuaJIT is included in the latest update of vcpkg, but if you want one that always statically links to the CRT, you can <a href=https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/luajit>get it here</a>.</p><p>An important note: the build instructions for LuaJIT state that you should copy the lua scripts contained in <code>src/jit</code> to your application folder. What it doesn&rsquo;t mention is that this is <em>optional</em> - those scripts contain debugging instructions for the JIT engine, which you probably don&rsquo;t need. It will work just fine without them.</p><p>Once you have LuaJIT built, you should add it&rsquo;s library file to your project. This library file is called <strong>lua51.lib</strong> (and the dll is <strong>lua51.dll</strong>), because LuaJIT is designed as a drop-in replacement for the default Lua runtime. Now we need to actually load Lua in our program and integrate it with our code. To do this, use <code>lua_open()</code>, which returns a <code>lua_State*</code> pointer. You will need that <code>lua_State*</code> pointer for everything else you do, so store it somewhere easy to get to. If you are building a game using an Entity Component System, it makes sense to build a <code>LuaSystem</code> that stores your <code>lua_State*</code> pointer.</p><h5 id=initialization>Initialization</h5><p>The next step is to load in all the standard Lua libraries using <code>luaL_openlibs(L)</code>. Normally, you shouldn&rsquo;t do this if you need script sandboxing for player-created scripts. However, <strong>LuaJIT&rsquo;s FFI library is inherently unsafe</strong>. Any script with access to the FFI library can call any kernel API it wants, so you should be extremely careful about using LuaJIT if this is a use-case for your game. We can also register any C functions we want to the old-fashioned way via <code>lua_register</code>, but this is only useful for functions that don&rsquo;t have C analogues (due to having multiple return values, etc).</p><p>There is one function in particular that you probably want to overload, and that is the <code>print()</code> function. By default, Lua will simply print to standard out, but if you aren&rsquo;t redirecting standard out to your in-game console, you probably have your own <code>std::ostream</code> (or even a custom stream class) that is sent all log messages. By overloading <code>print()</code>, we can have our Lua scripts automatically write to both our log file and our in-game console, which is extremely useful. Here is a complete re-implementation of <code>print</code> that outputs to an arbitrary <code>std::ostream&</code> object:<pre class=language-cpp><code>int PrintOut(lua_State *L, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  int n = lua_gettop(L);  /* number of arguments */
  if(!n)
    return 0;
  int i;
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;tostring&#34;);
  for(i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
  {
    const char *s;
    lua_pushvalue(L, -1);  /* function to be called */
    lua_pushvalue(L, i);   /* value to print */
    lua_call(L, 1, 1);
    s = lua_tostring(L, -1);  /* get result */
    if(s == NULL)
      return luaL_error(L, LUA_QL(&#34;tostring&#34;) &#34; must return a string to &#34;
        LUA_QL(&#34;print&#34;));
    if(i &gt; 1) out &lt;&lt; &#34;\t&#34;;
    out &lt;&lt; s;
    lua_pop(L, 1);  /* pop result */
  }
  out &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>To overwrite the existing <code>print</code> function, we need to first define a Lua compatible shim function. In this example, I pass <code>std::cout</code> as the target stream:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>int lua_Print(lua_State *L)
{
  return PrintOut(L, std::cout);
}
</code></pre>Now we simply register our <code>lua_Print</code> function using <code>lua_register(L, "print", &amp;lua_Print)</code>. If we were doing this in a <code>LuaSystem</code> object, our constructor would look like this:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>LuaSystem::LuaSystem()
{
  L = lua_open();
  luaL_openlibs(L);
  lua_register(L, &#34;print&#34;, &amp;lua_Print);
}
</code></pre>To clean up our Lua instance, we need to both trigger a final GC iteration to clean up any dangling memory, and then we call <code>lua_close(L)</code>, so our destructor would look like this:<pre class=language-cpp><code>LuaSystem::~LuaSystem()
{
  lua_gc(L, LUA_GCCOLLECT, 0);
  lua_close(L);
  L = 0;
}
</code></pre></p><h5 id=loadings-scripts-via-require>Loadings Scripts via Require</h5><p>At this point most tutorials skip to the part where you load a Lua script and write &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;, but we aren&rsquo;t done yet. Integrating Lua into your game means loading scripts and/or arbitrary strings as Lua code while properly resolving dependencies. If you don&rsquo;t do this, any one of your scripts that relies on another script will have to do <code>require("full/path/to/script.lua")</code>. We also face another problem - if we want to have a <code>scripts</code> folder where we simply automatically load every single script into our workspace, simply loading them all can cause duplicated code, because <code>luaL_loadfile</code> does <em>not</em> have any knowledge of <code>require</code>. You can solve this by simply loading a single <code>bootstrap.lua</code> script which then loads all your game&rsquo;s scripts via <code>require</code>, but we&rsquo;re going to build a much more robust solution.</p><p>First, we need to modify Lua&rsquo;s <code>PATH</code> variable, or the variable that controls where it looks up scripts relative to our current directory. This function will append a path (which should be of the form <code>"path/to/scripts/?.lua"</code>) to the beginning of the <code>PATH</code> variable, giving it highest priority, which you can then use to add as many <code>script</code> directories as you want in your game, and any lua script from any of those folders will then be able to <code>require()</code> a script from any other folder in <code>PATH</code> without a problem. Obviously, you should probably only add one or two folders, because you don&rsquo;t want to deal with potential name conflicts in your script files.<pre class=language-cpp><code>int AppendPath(lua_State *L, const char* path)
{
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;package&#34;);
  lua_getfield(L, -1, &#34;path&#34;); // get field &#34;path&#34; from table at top of stack (-1)
  std::string npath = path;
  npath.append(&#34;;&#34;);
  npath.append(lua_tostring(L, -1)); // grab path string from top of stack
  lua_pop(L, 1);
  lua_pushstring(L, npath.c_str());
  lua_setfield(L, -2, &#34;path&#34;); // set the field &#34;path&#34; in table at -2 with value at top of stack
  lua_pop(L, 1); // get rid of package table from top of stack
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>Next, we need a way to load all of our scripts using <code>require()</code> so that Lua properly resolves the dependencies. To do this, we create a function in C that literally calls the <code>require()</code> function for us:<pre class=language-cpp><code>int Require(lua_State *L,const char *name)
{
  lua_getglobal(L, &#34;require&#34;);
  lua_pushstring(L, name);
  int r = lua_pcall(L, 1, 1, 0);
  if(!r)
    lua_pop(L, 1);
  WriteError(L, r, std::cout);
  return r;
}
</code></pre>By using this to load all our scripts, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about loading them in any particular order - <code>require</code> will ensure everything gets loaded correctly. An important note here is <code>WriteError()</code>, which is a generic error handling function that processes Lua errors and writes them to a log. All errors in lua will return a nonzero error code, and will <em>usually</em> push a string containing the error message to the stack, which must then be popped off, or it&rsquo;ll mess things up later.<pre class=language-cpp><code>void WriteError(lua_State *L, int r, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  if(!r)
    return;
  if(!lua_isnil(L, -1)) // Check if a string was pushed
  {
    const char* m = lua_tostring(L, -1);
    out &lt;&lt; &#34;Error &#34; &lt;&lt; r &lt;&lt; &#34;: &#34; &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    lua_pop(L, 1);
  }
  else
    out &lt;&lt; &#34;Error &#34; &lt;&lt; r &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre></p><h5 id=automatic-c-binding-generation>Automatic C Binding Generation</h5><p>Fantastic, now we&rsquo;re all set to load up our scripts, but we still need to somehow define a header file and also load that header file into LuaJIT&rsquo;s FFI library so our scripts have direct access to our program&rsquo;s exposed C functions. One way to do this is to just copy+paste your C function definitions into a Lua file in your scripts folder that is then automatically loaded. This, however, is a pain in the butt and is error-prone. We want to have a <em>single source of truth</em> for our function definitions, which means defining our entire LuaJIT C API in a single header file, which is then loaded directly into LuaJIT. Predictably, we will accomplish this by abusing the C preprocessor:</p><p><pre class=language-cpp><code>#ifndef __LUA_API_H__
#define __LUA_API_H__

#ifndef LUA_EXPORTS
#define LUAFUNC(ret, name, ...) ffi.cdef[[ ret lua_##name(__VA_ARGS__); ]]; name = ffi.C.lua_##name
local ffi = require(&#34;ffi&#34;)
ffi.cdef[[ // Initial struct definitions
#else
#define LUAFUNC(ret, name, ...) ret __declspec(dllexport) lua_##name(__VA_ARGS__)
extern &#34;C&#34; { // Ensure C linkage is being used
#endif

struct GameInfo
{
  uint64_t DashTail;
  uint64_t MaxDash;
};

typedef const char* CSTRING; // VC++ complains about having const char* in macros, so we typedef it here

#ifndef LUA_EXPORTS
]] // End struct definitions
#endif

  LUAFUNC(CSTRING, GetGameName);
  LUAFUNC(CSTRING, IntToString, int);
  LUAFUNC(void, setdeadzone, float);

#ifdef Everglade_EXPORTS
}
#endif

#endif
</code></pre>The key idea here is to use macros such that, when we pass this through the preprocessor <em>without</em> any predefined constants, it will magically turn into a valid Lua script. However, when we compile it in our C++ project, our project defines <code>LUA_EXPORTS</code>, and the result is a valid C header. Our C <code>LUAFUNC</code> is set up so that we&rsquo;re using C linkage for our structs and functions, and that we&rsquo;re <em>exporting the function</em> via <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code>. This obviously only works for Visual Studio so you&rsquo;ll want to set up a macro for the GCC version, but I will warn you that VC++ got really cranky when i tried to use a macro for that in my code, so you may end up having to redefine the entire <code>LUAFUNC</code> macro for each compiler.</p><p>At this point, we have a bit of a choice to make. It&rsquo;s more convenient to have the C functions available in the global namespace, which is what this script does, because this simplifies calling them from an interactive console. However, <strong>using <code>ffi.C.FunctionName</code> is significantly faster</strong>. Technically the fastest way is declaring <code>local C = ffi.C</code> at the top of a file and then calling the functions via <code>C.FunctionName</code>. Luckily, importing the functions into the global namespace does not preclude us from using the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; way of calling them, so our script here imports them into the global namespace for ease of use, but in our scripts we can use the <code>C.FunctionName</code> method instead. Thus, when outputting our Lua script, our <code>LUAFUNC</code> macro wraps our function definition in a LuaJIT <code>ffi.cdef</code> block, and then runs a <em>second</em> Lua statement that brings the function into the global namespace. This is why we have an initial <code>ffi.cdef</code> code block for the structs up top, so we can include that second lua statement after each function definition.</p><p>Now we need to set up our compilation so that Visual Studio generates this file without any predefined constants and outputs the resulting lua script to our <code>scripts</code> folder, where our other in-game scripts can automatically load it from. We can accomplish this using a Post-Build Event (under Configuration Properties -> Build Events -> Post-Build Event), which then runs the following code:<pre class=language-cil><code>CL LuaAPI.h /P /EP /u
COPY &#34;LuaAPI.i&#34; &#34;../bin/your/script/folder/LuaAPI.lua&#34; /Y
</code></pre>Visual Studio can sometimes be finicky about that newline, but if you put in two statements on two separate lines, it should run both commands sequentially. You may have to edit the project file directly to convince it to actually do this. The key line here is <code>CL LuaAPI.h /P /EP /u</code>, which tells the compiler to preprocess the file and output it to a <code>*.i</code> file. There is no option to configure the output file, it will always be the exact same file but with a <code>.i</code> extension, so we have to copy and rename it ourselves to our scripts folder using the <code>COPY</code> command.</p><h5 id=loading-and-calling-lua-code>Loading and Calling Lua Code</h5><p>We are now set to load all our lua scripts in our script folder via <code>Require</code>, but what if we want an interactive Lua console? There are lua functions that read strings, but to make this simpler, I will provide a function that loads a lua script from an arbitrary <code>std::istream</code> and outputs to an arbitrary <code>std::ostream</code>:<pre class=language-cpp><code>const char* _luaStreamReader(lua_State *L, void *data, size_t *size)
{
  static char buf[CHUNKSIZE];
  reinterpret_cast&lt;std::istream*&gt;(data)-&gt;read(buf, CHUNKSIZE);
  *size = reinterpret_cast&lt;std::istream*&gt;(data)-&gt;gcount();
  return buf;
}

int Load(lua_State *L, std::istream&amp; s, std::ostream&amp; out)
{
  int r = lua_load(L, &amp;_luaStreamReader, &amp;s, 0);

  if(!r)
  {
    r = lua_pcall(L, 0, LUA_MULTRET, 0);
    if(!r)
      PrintOut(L, out);
  }

  WriteError(L, r, out);
  return r;
}
</code></pre>Of course, the other question is how to call Lua functions from our C++ code directly. There are many, <em>many</em> different implementations of this available, of varying amounts of safety and completeness, but to get you started, here is a very simple implementation in C++ using templates. Note that this does not handle errors - you can change it to use <code>lua_pcall</code> and check the return code, but <a href=http://www.knightsgame.org.uk/blog/2012/09/03/notes-on-luac-error-handling/>handling arbitrary Lua errors is nontrivial</a>.<pre class=language-cpp><code>template&lt;class T, int N&gt;

I pointed out that it was never designed for large-scale attacks, and that discord&rsquo;s own rate-limiting would likely make it useless. He revealed he was selling spambot accounts at a rate of about $1 for 100 unique accounts and that he was being attacked by a rival spammer. My anti-spam bot had been dragged into a turf war between two spambot networks. We discussed possible mitigation strategies for worst-case scenarios, but agreed that most of them would involve false-positives and that discord showed no interest in fixing how exploitable their API was. I hoped that I would never have to implement such extreme measures into my bot.</p><p>Yesterday, our server was attacked by over 40 spambots, and after discord&rsquo;s astonishingly useless &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; response, I was forced to do exactly that.</p><h5 id=a-brief-history-of-discord-bots>A Brief History of Discord Bots</h5><p>Discord is built on a REST API, which was reverse engineered by late 2015 and used to make unofficial bots. To test out their bots, they would hunt for servers to &ldquo;raid&rdquo;, invite their bots to the server, then spam so many messages it would softlock the client, because discord still didn&rsquo;t have any rate limiting. Naturally, as the designated punching bags of the internet, furries/bronies/Twilight fans/slash fiction writers/etc. were among the first targets. The attack on our server was so severe it took us almost 5 minutes of wrestling with an unresponsive client to ban them. Ironically, a few of the more popular bots today, such as &ldquo;BooBot&rdquo;, are banned as a result of that attack, because the first thing the bot creator did was use it to raid our server.</p><p>I immediately went to work building an anti-spam bot that muted anyone sending more than 4 messages per second. Building a program in a hostile environment like this is much different from writing a desktop app or a game, because the bot had to be bulletproof - it had to rate-limit itself and could not be allowed to crash, <em>ever</em>. Any bug that allowed a user to crash the bot was treated as P0, because it could be used by an attacker to cripple the server. Despite using a very simplistic spam detection algorithm, this turned out to be highly effective. Of course, back then, discord didn&rsquo;t have rate limiting, or verification, or role hierarchies, or searching chat logs, or even a way to look up where your last ping was, so most spammers were probably not accustomed to having to deal with <em>any</em> kind of anti-spam system.</p><p>I added raid detection, autosilence, an isolation channel, and join alerts, but eventually we were targeted by a group from 4chan&rsquo;s /pol/ board. Because this was a sustained attack, they began crafting spam attacks timed just below the anti-spam threshold. This forced me to implement a much more sophisticated anti-spam system, using a heat algorithm with a linear decay rate, which is still in use today. This improved anti-spam system eventually made the /pol/ group give up entirely. I&rsquo;m honestly amazed the simplistic &ldquo;X messages in Y seconds&rdquo; approach worked as long as it did.</p><p>Of course, none of this can defend against a large scale attack. As I learned by my chance encounter with an actual spammer, it was getting easier and easier to amass an army of spambots to assault a channel instead of just using one or two.</p><h5 id=anatomy-of-a-modern-spambot-attack>Anatomy Of A Modern Spambot Attack</h5><p>At peak times (usually during summer break), our server gets raided 1-2 times <em>per day</em>. These minor raids are often just 2-3 tweens who either attempt to troll the chat, or use a basic user script to spam an offensive message. Roughly 60-70% of these raids are either painfully obvious or immediately trigger the anti-spam bot. About 20% of the raids involve slightly intelligent attempts to troll the chat by being annoying without breaking the rules, which usually take about 5-10 minutes to be &ldquo;exposed&rdquo;. About 5-10% of the raids are large, involving 8 or more people, but they are also very obvious and can be easily confined to an isolation channel. Problems arise, however, with large <em>spambot</em> raids. Below is a timeline of the recent spambot attack on our server:</p><div style=width:100%;height:150px;background:#dfdfdf;border-radius:3px><div style=padding:10px;height:125px;position:relative><div style=transform:rotate(90deg);position:absolute;left:-1em;top:65px>messages</div><div class=datachart style=display:flex;width:320px;height:100%;align-items:flex-end><div class=ychart style="flex-shrink:0;font-size:.8em;width:3em;height:100%;padding-right:.2em;border-right:solid 1px #999;display:flex;justify-content:space-between;flex-direction:column;align-items:flex-end"></div></div><div style=width:100%><div style="border-top:solid 1px #999;font-size:.8em;position:relative;margin-left:3.2em"><div style=position:absolute;left:0>19:41:25</div><div style=position:absolute;left:80px>19:41:45</div><div style=position:absolute;left:160px>19:42:05</div><div style=position:absolute;left:240px>19:42:25</div><div style=position:absolute;left:320px>19:42:45</div></div></div></div></div><p>This was a botched raid, but the bots that actually worked started spamming within 5 seconds of joining, giving the moderators a very narrow window to respond. The real problem, however, is that so many of them joined, the bot&rsquo;s API calls to add a role to silence them were rate-limited. They also sent messages once every 0.9 seconds, which is designed to get around Discord&rsquo;s rate limiting. This amounted to 33 messages sent every second, but it was difficult for the anti-spam to detect. Had the spambots reduced their spam cadence to 3 seconds or more, this attack could have bypassed the anti-spam detection <em>entirely</em>. My bot now instigates a lockdown by raising the verification level when a raid is detected, but it simply can&rsquo;t silence users fast enough to deal with hundreds of spambots, so at some point the moderators must use a mass ban function. Of course, banning is restricted by the global rate limit, because <strong><a href=https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#create-guild-ban>Discord has no mass ban API endpoint</a></strong>, but luckily the global rate limit is something like 50 requests per second, so if you&rsquo;re <em>only</em> banning people, you&rsquo;re probably okay.</p><p>However, a hostile attacker could sneak bots in one-by-one every 10 minutes or so, avoiding setting off the raid alarm, and then activate them all at once. 500 bots sending randomized messages chosen from an English dictionary once every 5 seconds after sneaking them in over a 48 hour period is the ultimate attack, and one that is almost impossible to defend against, because this also bypasses the 10-minute verification level. As a weapon of last resort, I added a command that immediately bans all users that sent their first message within the past two minutes, but, again, banning is subject to the <a href=https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits>global rate limit!</a> In fact, the rate limits can change at any time, and while message deletion has a higher rate limit for bots, bans don&rsquo;t.</p><p>The only other option is to disable the @everyone role from being able to speak on any channel, but you have to do this on a <em>per channel basis</em>, because Discord ignores you if you attempt to globally disable sending message permissions for @everyone. Even then, creating an &ldquo;approved&rdquo; role doesn&rsquo;t work because any automated assignment could be defeated by adding bots one by one. The only defense a small Discord server has is to require moderator approval for every single new user, which isn&rsquo;t a solution - you&rsquo;ve just given up having a public Discord server. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until any angry 13-year-old can buy a sophisticated attack with a week&rsquo;s allowance. What will happen to public Discord servers then? Do we simply throw up our hands and admit that humanity is so awful we can&rsquo;t even have public communities anymore?</p><h5 id=the-discord-api-hates-you>The Discord API Hates You</h5><p>The rate-limits imposed on Discord API endpoints are exacerbated by temporary failures, and that&rsquo;s excluding network issues. Thus, if I attempt to set a silence role on a spammer that just joined, the API will repeatedly claim they do not exist. In fact, 3 separate API endpoints consistently fail to operate properly during a raid: A &ldquo;member joined&rdquo; event won&rsquo;t show up for several seconds, but if I fall back to calling <code>GetMember()</code>, this <em>also</em> claims the member doesn&rsquo;t exist, which means adding the role <em>also</em> fails! So I have to attempt to silence the user with every message they send until Discord actually adds the role, even though the API failures are also counted against the rate limit! This gets completely absurd once someone assaults your server with 1000 spambots, because this triggers all sorts of bottlenecks that normally aren&rsquo;t a problem. The alert telling you a user has joined? Rate limited. It&rsquo;ll take your bot 5-10 minutes to get through just <em>telling</em> you such a gigantic spambot army joined, unless you include code specifically designed to detect these situations and reduce the number of alerts. Because of this, a single user can trigger something like 5-6 API requests, all of which are counted against your global rate limit and can severely cripple a bot.</p><p>The general advice that is usually given here is &ldquo;just ban them&rdquo;, which is terrible advice because Discord&rsquo;s own awful message handling makes it incredibly easy to trigger a false positive. If a message fails to send, the client simply sends a completely new message, with it&rsquo;s own ID, and will continue re-sending the message until an Ack is received, at which point the user has probably send 3 or 4 copies of the same message, each of which have the same content, but completely unique IDs and timestamps, which looks <em>completely identical</em> to a spam attack.</p><p>Technically speaking, this is done because Discord assigns snowflake IDs server-side, so each message attempt sent by the client must have a unique snowflake assigned after it is sent. However, it can also be trivially fixed by adding an optional &ldquo;client ID&rdquo; field to the message, with a client-generated ID that stays the same if the message is resent due to a network failure. That way, the server (or the other clients) can simply drop any duplicate messages with identical client IDs while still ensuring all messages have unique IDs across their distributed cluster. This would single-handedly fix all duplicate messages across the entire platform, and eliminate almost every single false-positive I&rsquo;ve seen in my anti-spam bot.</p><h5 id=discord-doesnt-care>Discord Doesn&rsquo;t Care</h5><p>Sadly, Discord doesn&rsquo;t seem to care. The general advice in response to &ldquo;how do I defend against a large scale spam attack&rdquo; is &ldquo;just report them to us&rdquo;, so we did exactly that, and then got what has to be one of the dumbest customer service e-mails I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:571px><a href=/img/res4.PNG target=_blank><img src=/img/res4.PNG alt="Discord Being Stupid" width=100%></a></div><p>Excuse me, <em><strong>WHAT?!</strong></em> Sorry about somebody spamming your service with horrifying gore images, but please don&rsquo;t delete them! What happens if the spammers just delete the messages themselves? What happens if they send <em>child porn?</em> &ldquo;Sorry guys, please ignore the images that are literally illegal to even look at, but we can&rsquo;t delete them because Discord is fucking stupid.&rdquo; Does Discord understand the concept of <em>marking messages for deletion</em> so they are viewable for a short time as evidence for law enforcement?! My anti-spam bot&rsquo;s database currently has more information than <em>Discord&rsquo;s own servers!</em> If this had involved child porn, the FBI would have had to ask <strong>me</strong> for <strong>my records</strong> because Discord would have deleted them all!</p><p>Obviously, we&rsquo;re not going to leave 500+ gore messages sitting in the chatroom while Discord&rsquo;s ass-backwards abuse team analyzes them. I just have to hope my own nuclear option can ban them quickly enough, or simply give up the entire concept of having a public Discord server.</p><p>The problem is that the armies of spambots that were once reserved for the big servers are now so easy and so trivial to make that they&rsquo;re beginning to target smaller servers, servers that don&rsquo;t have the resources or the means to deal with that kind of large scale DDoS attack. So instead, I have to fight the growing swarm alone, armed with only a crippled, rate-limited bot of my own, and hope the dragons flying overhead don&rsquo;t notice.</p><p>What the <em>fuck</em>, Discord.</p><script src=https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js></script>

The most formal way this concept is expressed is that a company should make decisions based on what maximizes profits and not political opinions. Unfortunately, the statement &ldquo;companies should only care about maximizing profits&rdquo; is, itself, a political statement (and one I happen to disagree with). Thus, it is fundamentally impossible for a company to be <em>truly</em> apolitical, for the very act of attempting to be apolitical is a political statement.</p><p>How much a company can avoid politics generally depends on both the type and size of the company. Once your company becomes large enough, it will influence politics simply by virtue of its enormous size, and eventually becomes an integral part of political debates whether or wants to or not. Large corporations must take into account the political climate when making business decisions, because simply attempting to blindly maximize profit may turn the public against them and destroy their revenue sources—thus, politics themselves become part of the profit equation, and cannot be ignored. Certain types of businesses embody political statements simply by <em>existing</em>. Grindr, for example, is a dating app for gay men. It&rsquo;s entire business model is dependent on enabling an activity that certain fundamentalists consider inherently immoral.</p><p>You could, theoretically, try to solve part of this quandary by saying that companies should also be <em>amoral</em>, insofar that the free market should decide moral values. The fundamentalists would then protest the companies existence by not using it (but then, they never would have used it in the first place). However, the problem is that, once again, this very statement is itself political in nature. Thus, by either trying to be amoral or moral, a company is making a political statement.</p><p>The issue at play here is that <em>literally everything is political</em>. When most everyone agrees on basic moral principles, it&rsquo;s easier to pretend that politics is really just about economic policy and lawyers, but our current political divisions have demonstrated that this is a fantasy. Politics <em>are</em> the fundamental morals that society has decided on. It&rsquo;s just a lot easier to argue about minor differences in economic policy instead of fundamental differences in basic morality.</p><p>Of course, <em>how</em> companies participate in politics is also important to consider. Right now, a lot of companies participate in politics by spending exorbitant amounts of money on lobbyists. This is a symptom of money <em>in general</em>, and should be solved not by removing <em>corporate</em> money from politics, but removing <em>all</em> money, because treating spending money as a form of speech gives more speech to the rich, which inherently discriminates against the poor and violates the constitutional assertion that all men are created equal (but no one really seems to be paying attention to that line anyway).</p><p>Instead of using money, corporations should <em>do</em> things that uphold whatever political values they believe in. As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words (or money, in this case). You could support civil rights activism by being more inclusive with your hiring and promoting a diverse work environment. Or, if you live in the Philippines, you could create an app that helps death squads hunt down drug users so they can be brutally executed. What&rsquo;s interesting is that most people consider the latter to be a moral issue as opposed to a political one, which seems to derive from the fact that once you agree on most fundamental morals, we humans simply make up a bunch of pointless rules to satisfy our insatiable desire to tell other humans they&rsquo;re wrong.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve lived in a civilized world for so long, we&rsquo;ve forgotten the true roots of politics: a clash between our fundamental moral beliefs, not about how much parking fines should be.
