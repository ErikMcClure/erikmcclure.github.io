If you define <em>photorealistic</em> as <em>any still frame is indistinguishable from a real photo</em>, then we can get pretty close. Unfortunately, the problem with video games is that they are not still frames - they <em>move</em>.</p><p>What people don&rsquo;t realize is that modern games rely on faking a lot of stuff, and that means they only <em>look</em> photorealistic in a very tight set of circumstances. They rely on you not paying close attention to environmental details so you don&rsquo;t notice that the grass is actually just painted on to the terrain. They precompute environmental convolution maps and bake ambient occlusion and radiance information into level architecture. You can&rsquo;t knock down a building in a game unless it is specifically programmed to be breakable and all the necessary preparations are made. Changes in levels are often scripted, with complex physical changes and graphical consequences being largely precomputed and simply triggered at the appropriate time.</p><p>Modern photorealism, like the 3D graphics of ages past, is smoke and mirrors, the result of very talented programmers and artists using tricks of the eye to convince you that a level is much more detailed and interactive than it really is. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this, but we&rsquo;re so good at doing it that people think we&rsquo;re a heck of a lot closer to photorealistic games then we really are.</p><p>If you want to go beyond simple photorealism and build a game that <em>feels</em> real, you have to deal with a lot of extremely difficult problems. Our best antialiasing methods are perceptual, because doing real antialiasing is prohibitively expensive. Global illumination is achieved by deconstructing a level&rsquo;s polygons into an octree and using the GPU to cubify moving objects in realtime. Many advanced graphical techniques in use today depend on precomputed values and static geometry. The assumption that most of the world is probably going to stay the same is a powerful one, and enables huge amounts of optimization. Unfortunately, as long as we make that assumption, none of it will ever feel truly real.</p><p>Trying to build a world that does not take anything for granted rapidly spirals out of control. Where do you draw the line? Does gravity always point down? Does the atmosphere always behave the same way? Is the sun always yellow? What counts as solid ground? What happens when you blow it up? Is the object you&rsquo;re standing on even a <em>planet?</em> Imagine trying to code an engine that can take into account all of these possibilities <em>in realtime</em>. This is clearly horrendously inefficient, and yet there is no other way to achieve a <em>true</em> dynamic environment. At some point, we will have to make assumptions about what will and will not change, and these sometimes have surprising consequences. A volcanic eruption, for example, drastically changes the atmospheric composition and completely messes up the ambient lighting and radiosity.</p><p>Ok, well, at least we have dynamic animations, right? <strong>Wrong.</strong> Almost all modern games still use precomputed animations. Some fancy technology can occasionally try to interpolate between them, but that&rsquo;s about it. We have no reliable method of generating animations on the fly that don&rsquo;t look horrendously awkward and stiff. It turns out that trying to calculate a limb&rsquo;s shortest path from point A to point B while avoiding awkward positions and obstacles amounts to solving the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation>Euler-Lagrange equation</a> over an <em>n-dimensional manifold!</em> As a result, it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to create smooth animations, because our ability to fluidly shift from one animation to another is extremely limited. This is why we still have weird looking walk animations and occasional animation jumping.</p><p>The worst problem, however, is that of <em>content creation</em>. The simple fact is that at photorealistic detail levels, it takes way too long for a team of artists to build a believable world. Even if we had super amazing 3D modelers that would allow an artist to craft any small object in a matter of minutes (which we don&rsquo;t), artists aren&rsquo;t machines. Things look real because they have a history behind them, a reason for their current state of being. We can make photorealistic CGI for movies because each scene is scripted and has a well-defined scope. If you&rsquo;re building GTA V, you can&rsquo;t somehow manage to come up with three hundred unique histories for every single suburban house you&rsquo;re building.</p><p>Even if we <em>did</em> invent a way to render photorealistic graphics, it would all be for naught until we figured out a way to generate obscene amounts of content at incredibly high levels of detail. Older games weren&rsquo;t just easier to render, they were easier to <em>make</em>. There comes a point where no matter how many artists you hire, you simply can&rsquo;t build an expansive game world at a photorealistic level of detail in just 3 years.</p><p>People always talk about realtime raytracing as the holy grail of graphics programming without realizing just what is required to take advantage of it. Photorealism isn&rsquo;t just about processing power, it&rsquo;s about <em>content</em>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2014-03-18T09:05:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-problem-with-photorealism/>March 18, 2014 at 9:05am</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/the-problem-with-photorealism/#commento>8 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-problem-with-photorealism%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Problem%20With%20Photorealism&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-problem-with-photorealism%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-problem-with-photorealism%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/>Google's Decline Really Bugs Me</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Google is going down the drain.</p><p>That isn&rsquo;t to say they aren&rsquo;t fantastically successful. They are. I still use their products, mostly because I don&rsquo;t put things on the internet I don&rsquo;t want other people to find, and I&rsquo;m not female, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about misogynists stalking me. They still make stupendous amounts of money and pump out some genuinely good software. They still have the best search engine. Like Microsoft, they&rsquo;ll be a force to be reckoned with for many decades to come.</p><p>Google, however, represented an <em>ideal</em>. They founded the company with the motto &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Be Evil&rdquo;, and the unspoken question was, how long would this last? The answer, oddly enough, was &ldquo;until Larry Page took over&rdquo;.</p><p>In its early years, Google unleashed the creativity of the brilliant people it hired to the world and came up with a slew of fantastic products that were a joy to use. Google made huge contributions to the open-source world and solved scalability problems with an elegance that has yet to be surpassed. They famously let engineers use 20% of their time to pursue their own interests, and the result was an unstoppable tidal wave of innovation. Google was, for a brief moment, a shining beacon of hope, a force of good in a bleak world of corporations only concerned with maximizing profit.</p><p>Then Larry Page became CEO. Larry Page worshiped Steve Jobs, who gave him <a href=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-steve-jobs-influenced-googles.html>a bunch of bad advice</a> centered around <em>maximizing profit</em>. The result was predictable and catastrophic, as the entire basis of what had made Google so innovative was destroyed for the sake of <em>maximizing profit</em>. Now it&rsquo;s just another large company - only concerned about <em>maximizing profit</em>.</p><p>Google was a company that, for a time, I loved. To me, they represented the antithesis of Microsoft, a rebellion against a poisonous corporate culture dominated by profiteering that had no regard for its users. Google was just a bunch of really smart people trying to make the world a better place, and for a precious few years, they succeeded - until it all came tumbling down. Like an artist whose idol has become embroiled in a drug abuse scandal, I have lost my guiding light.</p><p>Google was largely the reason I wanted to start my own company, even if college kept me from doing so. As startup culture continued to suck the life out of silicon valley, I held on to Google as an ideal, an example of the kind of company I wanted to build instead of a site designed to sort cat photos. A company that made money because it solved real problems better than everyone else. A company that respected good programming practices, using the right tool for the job, and the value of actually <em>solving</em> a problem instead of just throwing more code at it.</p><p>Google was a company that solved problems first, and made money second.</p><p>Now, it has succumbed to maximizing stock price for a bunch of rich wall street investors who don&rsquo;t care about anything other than filling their own pockets with as much cash as they possibly can. Once again, the rest of the world is forced to sit around, waiting until an investor accidentally makes the world a better place in the process of trying to make as much money as possible.</p><p>Most people think this is the only way to get things done. For a precious few years, I could point to Google and say otherwise. Now, it has collapsed, and its collapse has made me doubt my own resolve. If Google, of all companies, couldn&rsquo;t maintain that idealistic vision, was it even <em>possible?</em></p><p>Google gave me a reason to believe that humanity could do better. That we could move past a Wall Street that has become nothing more than a rotting cesspool of greed and corruption.</p><p>Now, Google has fallen, along with the ideal it encompassed. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Or is it a train, a force of reality come to remind us that no matter how much we reach for utopia, we will be sentenced to drown in our own greed?</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-11-17T11:13:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/>November 17, 2013 at 11:13am</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/#commento>38 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fgoogles-decline-really-bugs-me%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Google%27s%20Decline%20Really%20Bugs%20Me&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fgoogles-decline-really-bugs-me%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fgoogles-decline-really-bugs-me%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/write-less-code/>Write Less Code</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><blockquote>*"Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."* - Albert Einstein ([paraphrased](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/#more-2363))</blockquote><p>The burgeoning complexity of software is perhaps one of the most persistent problems plaguing computer science. We have tried many, many ways of managing this complexity: inventing new languages, creating management systems, and enforcing coding styles. They have all proven to be nothing more than stopgaps. With the revelation that the NSA is utilizing the inherent complexity of software systems to sabotage our efforts at securing our systems, this problem has become even more urgent.</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to solve a problem with a lot of code - it&rsquo;s hard to solve a problem with a little code. Since most businesses do not understand the advantage of having high quality software, the most popular method of managing complexity is not to reduce how much code is used, but to wrap it up in a self-contained library so we can ignore it, instead. The problem with this approach is that you haven&rsquo;t gotten rid of the code. It&rsquo;s still there, it&rsquo;s just easier to ignore.</p><p>Until it breaks, that is. After we have wrapped complex systems into easy-to-use APIs, we then build even more complex systems on top of them, creating networks of interconnected components, each one encapsulating it&rsquo;s own complex system. Instead of addressing this burgeoning complexity, we simply wrap it into <em>another</em> API and pave over it, much like one would pave over a landfill. When it finally breaks, we have to <a href="http://ptrthomas.files.wordpress.com/2006/06/jtrac-callstack1.png?w=630">extract a core sample</a> just to get an idea of what might be going wrong.</p><p>One of the greatest contributions functional programming has made is its concept of a pure function with no side-effects. When a function has side effects, it&rsquo;s another edge on the graph of components where something could go wrong. Unfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t enough. If you simply replace a large complex system with a bunch of large complex functions that technically have no side-effects, it&rsquo;s still a large complex system.</p><p>Object-oriented programming tries to manage complexity by compartmentalizing things and (in theory) limiting how they interact with each other. This is designed to address spaghetti code that has a bunch of inter-dependent functions that are impossible to effectively debug. The OO paradigm has the right idea: &ldquo;an object should do exactly one thing, and do it well&rdquo;, but suffers from over-application. OO programming was designed to manage <em>very large complex objects</em>, not concepts that don&rsquo;t need Get/Set functions for every class member. Writing these functions <em>just in case</em> you need them in the future is a case of future-proofing, which should almost always be avoided. If there&rsquo;s an elegant, simple way to express a solution that only works given the constraints you currently have, <em><strong>USE IT</strong></em>. We don&rsquo;t need any more <a href=http://limejuice.fastmail.fm/expand-all-example.png>leaning towers of inheritance</a>.</p><p>The number of bugs in a software program is proportional to how much code you write, and that doesn&rsquo;t include cheap tricks like the ternary operator or importing a bunch of huge libraries. The logic is still there, the complexity is still there, and it will still break in mysterious ways. In order to reduce the complexity in our software, it has to do <em>less stuff</em>. The less code you write, the harder it is for the NSA to sabotage your program without anyone noticing. The less code you write, the fewer points of failure your program will have. The less code you write, the less stuff will break. We cannot hide from complexity any longer; we must actively reduce it. We have to begin excavating the landfill instead of paving over it.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-09-12T10:36:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/write-less-code/>September 12, 2013 at 10:36am</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/write-less-code/#commento>1 comment</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwrite-less-code%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Write%20Less%20Code%20%20&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwrite-less-code%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwrite-less-code%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/leap-motion-impressions-input/>Leap Motion Impressions, Input Sanitation, and 3D Gesture Ideas</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><blockquote>**Pros:**<ul><li>For the most part, does what it claims it does, and gives you extremely precise, fast tracking of fingers.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Really hates thumbs for some reason.</li><li>Has a lot of trouble with pens or other implements.</li><li>Fingers must be separated.</li><li>Fairly easy to get positions that break the camera because it can&rsquo;t see the fingers.</li><li><em>No one has any idea how to write software for it.</em></blockquote></li></ul><p>I just got my Leap Motion device today, and for the most part, I like it. It does most of the things I expected it to do. It seems like something that could become very useful down the line. Unfortunately, right now, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend getting one if you wanted something that&rsquo;s more than a toy.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t entirely the fault of the device itself, but more a combination of driver limitations and boneheaded software that doesn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s doing. The device is so new, no one knows how to properly utilize it, so almost all the apps that exist right now are either garbage or ridiculously sensitive to your setup. There are, however, a few more serious problems that should be addressed by the Leap Motion team.</p><p>First of all, the driver hates thumbs. It seems like it&rsquo;s trying to edit them out when they aren&rsquo;t positioned like a finger, which makes any sort of pinching gesture impossible to do. In addition, it doesn&rsquo;t like it when you try to use a pen, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s specifically designed to let you do so. Both of these problems seem more like driver analysis problems, so I expect they&rsquo;ll be corrected soon. I know these aren&rsquo;t hardware limitations, because the camera can see the stupid pen, the driver just has to recognize it as a tool and disregard the hand holding it, which is really doesn&rsquo;t want to do - It&rsquo;s obsessed with hands. I should call it the Lyra driver from now on.</p><p>A more fundamental and concerning issue is the ease in which I can assume a position that blocks the camera&rsquo;s view of some or most of my fingers. Pretty much anything that involves my fingers being vertically aligned breaks the driver, along with everything from a roughly 90 degree to 135 degree angle, pointed away from the device. This appears to be an inherent issue with the device itself, and its the same problem the kinect would have, because the camera&rsquo;s view of the fingers gets blocked. How much more effective would a leap motion device with <em>two</em> cameras, one on either side of the monitor, be? Or just a wider camera angle (since it&rsquo;s using dual emitters anyway to get depth information). As it is right now, it&rsquo;s cute and futuristic looking, but any minority-report-esque gestures completely break it.</p><p>A much more unexpected issue is the fact that the device makes no attempt to deal with fingers that are held together, despite the fact that the shape of two touching fingers is fairly easy to figure out. If you&rsquo;ve been tracking one finger and suddenly it meets up with another one and you end up with one really wide &ldquo;finger&rdquo;, it should be trivial to send this information as a &ldquo;double finger&rdquo; pointing, because this is an incredibly useful gesture (see below for details). It&rsquo;s not like the finger is going to change into a hippopotamus all of a sudden.</p><h5 id=3d-gestures>3D Gestures</h5><p>Most of the other problems are software oriented, not hardware or driver related. The simple fact is that no one has any idea how to properly utilize the device. Most apps seem to assume there&rsquo;s only going to be one finger pointed at the screen, and will get confused if you have any other fingers hanging off even if they&rsquo;re not pointed at the screen. The Leap Motion driver gives you a rough estimate of what it thinks the hand orientation is, and using this information its fairly trivial to figure out which finger someone is pointing with, even if their other fingers are only slightly below that finger. The camera is on a flat surface at a 90 degree angle from the screen, which means the finger you want is almost always going to be the finger that is the &ldquo;highest&rdquo; in relation to the hand orientation.</p><p>The rest of the apps either don&rsquo;t do much processing on the raw data, or do an incredibly bad job of it. The touch screen recreation had this horrible tendency to start sliding off, and the cursor would sometimes jump around. I knew it shouldn&rsquo;t be doing that because I&rsquo;ve been watching the diagnostic information and it&rsquo;s just getting confused by ghost fingers popping in and out. Guess what? A finger can&rsquo;t teleport. If you&rsquo;ve been tracking one finger, chances are you should keep tracking it no matter what else happens.</p><p>In addition, no one&rsquo;s really come up with effective 3D gestures. All the apps try to use the 3D plane by turning it into a virtual touchscreen and it doesn&rsquo;t work very well. Instead, we should be using gestures that are independent of a 2D plane. The apps need to be paying attention to the angle the finger is pointing in instead of trying to rely on moving your entire hand around. It seems like everyone is using the position information instead of the angle information, which the driver provides. If I&rsquo;m pointing up and to the right, my cursor should be in the corner of the screen no matter where my hand is.</p><p>Furthermore, no one seems to be trying very hard to deal with noise. When the driver starts losing precision, you can tell because the angle information or position information will start to jitter. The more jittering, the less accurate the reading is. A simple way to quantify this is by calculating the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance>variance</a> of the recent data. The higher the variance, the less accurate your reading is. You should then scale how heavily you average out the points based on how much variance there is in the data. This allows you to avoid destroying precision while preventing the cursor from exploding when you lose accuracy. There&rsquo;s a lot of algorithms dedicated to solving this exact problem, so it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous that no one is using them. In a more specific scenario, humans do precise manipulations with their fingers, not their hands. Small pertubations in the input data that occur in the hands should be removed from the finger positions, because it&rsquo;s just the hand trembling, not the actual finger.</p><p>Instead of trying to recreate &ldquo;pushing a button&rdquo; in 3D, we should use a gesture interface that lets you move the cursor around with your index finger, and then when you bring up your middle finger against your index finger (so you are now pointing at the screen with two fingers), this counts as a &ldquo;click&rdquo; or a mouse-down. You can then drag things around with two fingers, or separate them to generate a mouse-up event. To right-click, bring your two fingers together again, and then rotate your hand clockwise. This could be combined with a more traditional &ldquo;pushing a button&rdquo; gesture for easier clicks, but provides a much more robust way of moving things around that isn&rsquo;t awkward or difficult to use.</p><p>Since the driver currently doesn&rsquo;t let you track two fingers held together, this same behavior can be emulated by simply keeping track of two fingers and detecting when both of them accelerate towards each other until one of them vanishes. On this same note, because fingers can drop out of tracking, programs can&rsquo;t rely on the driver to be perfect. If you lose track of a finger, it&rsquo;s not that hard to guess where it might be based on the orientation of the hand, which is necessary if we&rsquo;re going to have good gesture recognition. The recognizer needs to be able to interpolate likely positions of lost fingers if it&rsquo;s going to make an effective guess about what gesture was intended.</p><p>Leap Motion is really cool. Leap Motion is definitely the future. Unfortunately, we haven&rsquo;t gotten to the future yet. We need a better software framework to build gesture interfaces on top of, and we need a new standard set of gestures for 3D that aren&rsquo;t simply 2D ripoffs. Incidentally, I&rsquo;d love to try building an open-source library that addresses a lot of the input sanitation problems I outlined in this article, but I&rsquo;m a bit busy with the whole &ldquo;finding a job so I don&rsquo;t starve to death&rdquo; thing. Hopefully, someone else will take up the cause, but until they do, don&rsquo;t expect to be very productive with the Leap Motion.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2013-07-23T17:05:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/leap-motion-impressions-input/>July 23, 2013 at 5:05pm</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/leap-motion-impressions-input/#commento> comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fleap-motion-impressions-input%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Leap%20Motion%20Impressions%2c%20Input%20Sanitation%2c%20and%203D%20Gesture%20Ideas&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fleap-motion-impressions-input%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fleap-motion-impressions-input%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/aurora-theory-released/>Aurora Theory Released!</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Aurora Theory has been released!
