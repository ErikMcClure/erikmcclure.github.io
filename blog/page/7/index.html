Instead, I am designing software for a bunch of highly emotional, irrational creatures called *human beings*, all of whom have enormously different tastes. I try to include options, or customization, or if that isn't possible, a compromise. I try to keep the door open, to let my software be used as a tool to enhance someone's productivity no matter what workflow they use, instead of trying to impose my own workflow on them.<p>For some reason, many programmers seem to struggle with the concept of people being different. They get hung up on this naïve concept of <em>right</em> or <em>wrong</em>, as if life is some kind of mathematical equation that has a closed form solution. Let me say right now that any solution to life is going to be one heck of a chaotic nonlinear PDE, which won&rsquo;t have any closed form solution at all, and certainly not one using elementary functions. When you are developing software, you must keep in mind the <em>range</em> of customers who will be using your product, whether they are office workers or fellow programmers.</p><p>Maybe someone is using your product to try and finish a presentation in time to go home and catch a nap before they get up to work their second job so they can support a wife and a screaming baby. Someone else might use your product to track their progress as they try to revolutionize search from their bedroom instead of study for their finals next week. Someone else might be an elderly man trying to figure out how his vacation is going to go.</p><p><em>We are all different</em>. We arise from all walks of life and are bound together in a great journey on this blue ball hurtling through space. It is not cowardice when two people try to put aside their differences and work together, it is strength. It requires enormous courage to admit that there are no simple answers in life. There are no answers in the back of the textbook. There are many different answers, all different in subtle ways, all suitable for slightly different circumstances, all both <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em> in their own, strange, quirky ways.</p><p>Some programmers seem distressingly incapable of compassion or empathy. Many claim to live through the cold hard logic of <em>data</em>, without apparently realizing that data itself is inherently meaningless. It is only given meaning through a human&rsquo;s interpretation, and a human can interpret data to mean whatever they want. They seem to think they can solve problems by reducing everyone into neat little collections of numbers that can be easily analyzed. It&rsquo;s certainly a lot less frustrating to work with real numbers instead of real people, but inevitably, a programmer must come to terms with the fact that life is about <em>human beings</em>, not numbers on a screen.</p><p>The cold hard logic of our code is good for speaking to computers—it is not good for speaking to other human beings.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2015-06-15T01:13:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/you-arent-designing-software-for-robots/>June 15, 2015 at 1:13am</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/you-arent-designing-software-for-robots/#commento>2 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fyou-arent-designing-software-for-robots%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=We%20Aren%27t%20Designing%20Software%20For%20Robots&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fyou-arent-designing-software-for-robots%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fyou-arent-designing-software-for-robots%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/using-data-to-balance-your-game-pony/>Using Data To Balance Your Game: Pony Clicker Analysis</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><blockquote>*The only thing more addicting than heroine are numbers that keep getting larger.*</blockquote><p>Incrementer and idle games are seemingly simplistic games where you wait or click to increase a counter, then use that counter to buy things to make the counter go up faster. Because of the compounding effects involved, these types of games inevitably turn into a study of growth rates and how different functions interact. <a href=http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/>Cookie Clicker</a> is perhaps the most well-known, which employs an exponential growth curve for the costs of buildings that looks like this:</p><div class=math>\[ Cost_n = Cost_0\cdot 1.15^n \]</div><p>Where <span class=math>$$ Cost_0 $$</span> is the initial cost of the building. Each building, however, has a fixed income, and so the entire game is literally the player trying to purchase upgrades and buildings to fight against an interminable exponential growth curve of the cost function. Almost every single feature added to Cookie Clicker is yet another way to battle the growth rate of the exponential function, delaying the plateauing of the CPS as long as possible. This includes the reset functionality, which grants heavenly chips that yield large CPS bonuses. However, no feature can compensate for the fact that the buildings do not have a sufficient growth rate to keep up with the exponential cost function, so you inevitably wind up in a dead end where it becomes almost impossible to buy anything in a reasonable amount of time regardless of player action.</p><p>Pony Clicker is based off Cookie Clicker, but takes a different approach. Instead of having set rates for each building, each building generates a number of smiles based on the number of ponies and friendships that you have, along with other buildings that &ldquo;synergize&rdquo; with that building. The more expensive buildings generate more smiles because they have a higher growth rate than the buildings below them. This makes the game extremely difficult to balance, because you only have equations and the cost curves to work with, instead of simply being able to set the per-building SPS. Furthermore, the SPS of a building continues to grow and change over the course of the game, further complicating the balance equation. Unfortunately, in the first version of the game, the growth rate of the end building exceeded the growth rate of the cost function, which resulted in immense end-game instability and all around unhappiness. To address balance problems in pony clicker, rather than simply throwing ideas at the wall and trying to play test them infinitely, I wrote a program that played the game for me. It uses a nearly optimal strategy of buying whatever the most efficient building is in terms of cost per +1 SPS increase. This is not a perfectly optimal strategy, which has to take into account how long the next building will need to take, but it was pretty close to how players tended to play.</p><p>Using this, I could analyze a game of pony clicker in terms of what the SPS looked like over time. My first graph was not very promising:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7786493/21b10990-0188-11e5-86de-7eaa7d5e07d5.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7786493/21b10990-0188-11e5-86de-7eaa7d5e07d5.png width=100%></a></div><p>The SPS completely exploded and it was obviously terrible. To help me figure out what was going on, I included a graph of the optimal store purchases and the time until the next optimal purchase. My goal in terms of game experience was that no building would be left behind, and that there shouldn&rsquo;t be enormous gaps between purchases. I also wanted to make sure that the late game or the early game didn&rsquo;t take too long to get through.</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7786492/1ccd4ac4-0188-11e5-840b-d3a47f4a898a.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7786492/1ccd4ac4-0188-11e5-840b-d3a47f4a898a.png width=100%></a></div><p>In addition to this, I created a graph of the estimate SPS generation of each individual building, on a per-friendship basis. This helped compensate for the fact that the SPS changed as the game state itself changed, allowing me to ensure the SPS generation of any one building wasn&rsquo;t drastically out of whack with the others, and that it increased on a roughly linear scale.</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7787681/f5c01296-01cc-11e5-829e-a0e9e1f89334.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7787681/f5c01296-01cc-11e5-829e-a0e9e1f89334.png width=100%></a></div><p>This information was used to balance the game into a much more sane curve:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7899795/3bb8210c-06e7-11e5-9514-1b66669631dc.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7899795/3bb8210c-06e7-11e5-9514-1b66669631dc.png width=100%></a></div><p>I then added upgrades to the main graph, and quickly learned that I was giving the player certain upgrades way too fast:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7806412/491fa6cc-0335-11e5-8e2e-6e6903d94240.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7806412/491fa6cc-0335-11e5-8e2e-6e6903d94240.png width=100%></a></div><p>This was used to balance the upgrades and ensure they only gave a significant SPS increase when it was really needed (between expensive buildings, usually). The analysis page itself is <a href=https://erikmcclure.github.io/PonyClicker/utilities/analysis.html>available here</a>, so you can look at the current state of pony clicker&rsquo;s growth curve.</p><p>These graphs might not be perfect, but they are incredibly helpful when you are trying to eliminate exponential explosions. If you got a value that spirals out of control, a graph will tell you <em>immediately</em>. It makes it very easy to quickly balance purchase prices, because you can adjust the prices and see how this affects the optimal gameplay curve. Pony Clicker had so many interacting equations it was basically the <em>only</em> way i could come up with a game that was even remotely balanced (although it still needs some work). It&rsquo;s a great example of how important <strong>rapid feedback</strong> is when designing something. If you can get immediate feedback on what changing something does, it makes the process of refining something much faster, which lets you do a better job of refining it. It also lets you experiment with things that would otherwise be way too complex to balance by hand.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2015-05-30T10:36:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/using-data-to-balance-your-game-pony/>May 30, 2015 at 10:36am</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/using-data-to-balance-your-game-pony/#commento>4 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fusing-data-to-balance-your-game-pony%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Using%20Data%20To%20Balance%20Your%20Game%3a%20Pony%20Clicker%20Analysis&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fusing-data-to-balance-your-game-pony%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fusing-data-to-balance-your-game-pony%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/does-anyone-actually-want-good-software/>Does Anyone Actually Want Good Software?</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Are there any programmers left that actually care about writing good software? As far as I can tell, the software development industry has turned into a series of echo chambers where managers scream about new features and shipping software and analyzing feedback from customers. Then they ignore all the feedback and implement whatever new things are supposed to be cool, like flat design, or cloud computing, or software as a service.</p><p>The entire modern web is built on top of the worst programming language that&rsquo;s still remotely popular. It&rsquo;s so awful that <a href=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/02/18/bringing-asm-js-to-the-chakra-javascript-engine-in-windows-10.aspx>IE now supports asm.js</a> just so we can use other languages instead. With everyone relentlessly misquoting &ldquo;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s hard to get programmers to optimize any of their code <em>at all</em>, let alone get them to care about things like CPU caches and why allocation on the heap is slow and how memory locality matters.</p><p>Some coders exist at large corporations that simply pile on more and more lines of code and force everyone to use gigantic frameworks built on top of more gigantic frameworks built on top of even more gigantic frameworks and then wonder why everything is so slow. Other coders exist in startups that use Scala/Hadoop/Node.js and care only about pumping out features or fixing bugs. The thing is, all of these companies make a lot of money, which leads me to ask, <em>does anyone actually want good software anymore?</em></p><p>Do customers simply not care? Is everyone ok with Skype randomly not sending messages and trying (poorly) to sync all your messages and randomly deciding that certain actions are always unread on other computers and dropping calls and creating all sorts of other strange and bizarre bugs? Is everyone ok with an antivirus that demands you sign in to a buggy window that keeps losing focus every time you try to type in your password? Is everyone ok with Visual Studio deciding it needs to open a text file and taking 15 seconds to actually start up an entirely new instance even though I already have one running just to display the stupid file?</p><p>It seems to me that we&rsquo;re all so obsessed with making cool stuff, we&rsquo;ve forgotten how to make stuff that <em>actually works</em>.</p><p>Did you know that every single person I know (except for two people) hates flat design? They don&rsquo;t like it. I don&rsquo;t like it. There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuckup, narcissistic designers shoving flat design down everyone&rsquo;s throats and <em>I hate it</em>. The designers don&rsquo;t care. They insist that it&rsquo;s elegant and modern and a bunch of other crap that&rsquo;s all entirely subjective no matter how hard they try to pretend otherwise. Design is about opinions. If I don&rsquo;t like your design, you can&rsquo;t just go and say my opinion is wrong. My opinion isn&rsquo;t wrong, I just don&rsquo;t agree with you. There&rsquo;s a difference.</p><p>However, it has become increasingly apparent to me that opinions aren&rsquo;t allowed in programming. I&rsquo;m not allowed to say that garbage collectors are bad for high performance software. I&rsquo;m not allowed to say that pure functional programming isn&rsquo;t some kind of magical holy grail that will solve all your problems. I&rsquo;m not allowed to say that flat design is stupid. I&rsquo;m definitely not allowed to say that I hate Python, because apparently Python is a religion.</p><p>Because of this, I am beginning to wonder if I am simply delusional. Apparently I&rsquo;m the only human being left on planet earth who really, really doesn&rsquo;t like typing magical bullshit into his linux terminal just to get basic things working instead of having a GUI that wasn&rsquo;t designed by brain-dead monkeys. Apparently, I&rsquo;m the only one who is entirely willing to pay money for services instead of having awful, ad-infested online versions powered by JavaScript™ and Node.js™ that fall over every week because someone forgot to cycle the drives in a cloud service 5000 miles away. Apparently, no one can fix the <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-not-to-sell-software/>audio sample library industry</a> or the fact that most of my VSTi&rsquo;s manage to use 20% of my CPU <em>when they aren&rsquo;t actually doing anything</em>.</p><p>Am I simply getting old? Has the software industry left me behind? Does anyone else out there care about these things? Should I throw in the towel and call it quits? Is the future of software development writing terrible monstrosities held together by duct tape? Is this the only way to have a sustainable business?</p><p>Is this the world our customers want? Because it sure isn&rsquo;t what I want.</p><p>Unfortunately, writing music doesn&rsquo;t pay very well.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2015-02-18T23:10:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/does-anyone-actually-want-good-software/>February 18, 2015 at 11:10pm</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/does-anyone-actually-want-good-software/#commento>11 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdoes-anyone-actually-want-good-software%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Does%20Anyone%20Actually%20Want%20Good%20Software%3f&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdoes-anyone-actually-want-good-software%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdoes-anyone-actually-want-good-software%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/how-not-to-sell-software/>How Not To Install Software</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again, when everyone and their pony puts on a sale, except now it seems to have started much earlier than the traditional Black Friday. Needless to say, this is the only time of year I go around buying expensive sample libraries. One of these libraries was recommended by a friend: LA Scoring Strings - First Chair 2, a cheaper version of LA Scoring Strings. It&rsquo;s $100 off, which is pretty nice, except that the page that describes the product <a href=http://audiobro.com/la-scoring-strings/la-scoring-strings-first-chair/>doesn&rsquo;t actually have a link to buy it</a>. You have to click the STORE link, and then buy it from <em>there</em>, because this is a completely obvious and intuitive interface design (it isn&rsquo;t).</p><p>So, after finding the proper link in the Store and verifying I am actually purchasing what I want to purchase, they give me exactly one payment option: Paypal. This is pretty common, so we&rsquo;ll let it slide, and the whole process seems to go smoothly until they give me my receipt. On the receipt page, they gave me a link to download the files, and a serial number. How helpful! Until I click the download link, which does not open in a new window, and instead opens a completely different webpage with absolutely no way to get back to the page I was just on, because there is no store page with this information and I have no user account on this site. So, I have to go to my e-mail, where they have helpfully e-mailed me a copy of the receipt (probably for this exact reason) to get the serial number.</p><p>I then go back to the download page only to discover that I am <em>required</em> to use their stupid download manager in order to download the product I just bought. There is no alternative option whatsoever. So I download their stupid download manager and it magically installs itself somewhere on my computer I will likely never be able to find because it never asked my permission to do anything, and then demands that I log in. Well, obviously, I don&rsquo;t have a log in, and no one asked me to register until now, so I go to register, which helpfully opens my web browser to register&mldr; on a forum. Well, ok, so I register on the forum with a randomly generated password, and activate my account.</p><p>So naturally, they then <strong>e-mail my password back to me</strong>, which by definition means they are storing it in plaintext. So now the password to my account was sent over an unencrypted, entirely open channel, which is insanely stupid, but this is just a sample library, so whatever. I go back to their download manager and put in my credentials and&mldr; the login fails. Well, maybe it takes a bit to propagate - no, it just isn&rsquo;t working. I try again, and triple check that I have the password right. I log out and back into the forum with that very same password, and it still works. It just doesn&rsquo;t work in the application.</p><p>Standard procedure at this point is for me to take every single weird punctuation character out of my password (making it much weaker) to address the possibility that these people are pants on head retarded and can&rsquo;t handle a password with punctuation in it. I change my password to an alphanumeric one, and lo and behold, I can suddenly log in to the download manager! Let&rsquo;s think about this for a moment. The password I used had some punctuation characters in it (like &ldquo;!&amp;#*@(?&rdquo; etc.), but in order to make sure it was still a valid password, I logged in to the forum with that password, and it succeeded. I then went to this application and put in the <em>same password</em> and it failed to log me in, which means the program actually only accepts some random subset of all valid passwords that the forum lets you register with.</p><p>This is laughably bad programming, but my woes aren&rsquo;t over yet. I click the download button only to get this incredibly helpful message: &ldquo;Cannot connect to download servers.&rdquo; Pissed off, I go play a game in the hopes that once I get back, the servers will work again. I close the game only to discover that my download manager is one giant grey screen no matter what i do to it. It&rsquo;s forgotten how to draw it&rsquo;s own UI at this point. I restart the program, and it has (of course) helpfully forgotten my login credentials. This time, it displays a EULA it apparently forgot to show me the first time around, and once I accept, clicking install successfully starts downloading the files!</p><p>Of course, once the files are installed, they aren&rsquo;t actually <em>installed</em> installed. I have to go into Kontakt and add the libraries to it&rsquo;s magical library in order for them to actually get recognized. I can&rsquo;t tell if this is AudioBro&rsquo;s fault or Native Instruments fault, but at this point I don&rsquo;t care, because this has already become the worst installation experience of any piece of software I have had to go through <em>in my entire life</em>.</p><p>What&rsquo;s frightening is that this is par for the course across the desolate wasteland that is Audio Sample Libraries. The entire audio engineering industry employs draconian and ultimately ineffective DRM security measures, often bundled with installers that look like they were written in 1998 and never updated. The entire industry uses software that is grotesquely bloated, digging it&rsquo;s filthy claws into my operating system and doing all sorts of unspeakable things, and there is <strong>no way out</strong>.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t disrupt this field, because samples rule everything. If you have good samples, people will buy your shitty sample libraries. EastWest moved from Kontakt (which is a pretty shitty piece of software considering it&rsquo;s the best sampler in the entire industry) to their own proprietary PLAY engine, which is unstable, bloated, entirely dependent on ASIO4ALL to even <em>work</em>, and prone to crashing. They still make tons of money, because <em>they have the best orchestral samples</em>, which means people will put up with their incredibly bad sampler just so they can use their samples, which are all in a proprietary format that will get you violently sued if you attempt to reverse engineer it.</p><p>So, even if you develop the best sampler in the world, it won&rsquo;t matter, because without samples, your software is dead on arrival. Almost all the samples that are worth having come in proprietary formats that your program can&rsquo;t understand, and no one can convert these samples to another format (unless they want to reverse engineer the program and get sued, that is). So now the entire sampling industry is locked in a oligopoly of competing samplers that refuse to talk to each other, thus crushing competition by making the cost of entrance so prohibitively high no one can possibly compete with them. And then you get this shit.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2014-11-26T18:53:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-not-to-sell-software/>November 26, 2014 at 6:53pm</a></time><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/how-not-to-sell-software/#commento> comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-not-to-sell-software%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20Not%20To%20Install%20Software&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-not-to-sell-software%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-not-to-sell-software%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/can-we-choose-what-we-enjoy/>Can We Choose What We Enjoy?</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>One of the most bizarre arguments I have ever heard in ethics is whether or not people can choose to be gay or not. The idea is, if being gay is genetically predetermined, it&rsquo;s not their fault, therefore you can&rsquo;t prosecute them for something they have no control over.</p><p>Since when did <em>anyone</em> get to choose what makes them happy? Can you <em>choose</em> to like strawberries? Can you <em>choose</em> to enjoy the smell of dandelions? At best, you can subject yourself to something over and over and over again and enjoy it as a sort of acquired taste, but this doesn&rsquo;t always work, and the fact remains that you are still predisposed to enjoying certain experiences. Unless we make a concentrated effort to change our preferences, <em>all</em> enjoyable sensory experiences occur <em>without our consent</em>. We are not in charge of what combination of neural impulses our brain happens to find enjoyable. All we can do is slowly influence those preferences, and even then, only sometimes.</p><p>This concept of people <em>choosing</em> what they enjoy seems to have infected society, and is often at the root of much bizarre and often unfair prosecution. If we assume that people cannot significantly change the preferences they were dealt by life, either as a result of genetic or environmental influences, a host of moral issues become apparent.</p><p>Gender roles stop making sense. In fact, prosecuting anyone on the LGTB spectrum immediately becomes invalid. Attacking anyone&rsquo;s sexual preferences, provided they are harmless, becomes unacceptable. Trying to attack anyone&rsquo;s artistic or musical preferences becomes difficult, at best. We know for a fact that someone&rsquo;s culinary preferences are influenced by the genetic distribution of taste buds in their mouth. It&rsquo;s even hard to properly critique someone&rsquo;s fashion choices if they happened to despise denim or some other fabric.</p><p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the answer to the question &ldquo;why would someone like [x]&rdquo; is always &ldquo;because their brain is wired in a way that enjoys it.&rdquo; Humans are, at a fundamental level, sensory processing machines that accidentally achieved self-awareness. We enjoy something because we are programmed to enjoy it. To insult what kinds of sensory input someone enjoys simply because they do not match up with your own is laughably juvenile. The only time this kind of critique is valid is when someone&rsquo;s preferences cause harm to another person. We all have our own unique ways of processing sensory input, and so we will naturally enjoy different things, through no fault of our own. Sometimes, with a substantial amount of effort, we can slowly change some of those preferences, but most of the time, we&rsquo;re stuck with whatever we were born with (or whatever environmental factors shaped our perception in our childhood).</p><p>Instead of accusing someone of liking something you don&rsquo;t approve of, maybe next time you should try to understand <em>why</em> they like it, instead.
