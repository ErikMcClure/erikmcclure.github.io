This behavior can cause all sorts of mayhem, like your program just vanishing into thin air without any error messages due to a stack overflow that terminated the program without actually throwing an exception. What I didn't realize is that it also eats <code>assert()</code>, which makes debugging hell, because the assertion would throw, the entire user callback would immediately terminate without any stack unwinding, and then windows would just&mldr; keep going, even though the program is now in a laughably corrupt state, because only half the function executed.</p><p>While trying to find a way to fix this, I discovered that there are no less than 4 different ways windows can choose to eat exceptions from your program. I had already told the kernel to stop eating my exceptions using the following code:<pre class=language-cpp><code>HMODULE kernel32 = LoadLibraryA(&#34;kernel32.dll&#34;);   
assert(kernel32 != 0);   
tGetPolicy pGetPolicy = (tGetPolicy)GetProcAddress(kernel32, &#34;GetProcessUserModeExceptionPolicy&#34;);  
tSetPolicy pSetPolicy = (tSetPolicy)GetProcAddress(kernel32, &#34;SetProcessUserModeExceptionPolicy&#34;);   
if(pGetPolicy &amp;&amp; pSetPolicy &amp;&amp; pGetPolicy(&amp;dwFlags))  
  pSetPolicy(dwFlags &amp; \~EXCEPTION_SWALLOWING); // Turn off the filter</code></pre>However, despite this, COM itself was wrapping an entire <code>try {} catch {}</code> statement around my program, so I had to figure out how to turn that off, too. Apparently <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110120-00/?p=11713/">some genius at Microsoft</a> decided the default behavior should be to just swallow exceptions whenever they were making COM, and now they can't change this default behavior because it'd break all the applications that now depend on COM eating their exceptions to run properly! So, I turned that off with this code:<pre class=language-cpp><code>CoInitialize(NULL); // do this first   
if(SUCCEEDED(CoInitializeSecurity(NULL, -1, NULL, NULL, RPC_C_AUTHN_L_VEL_PKT_PRIVACY, RPC_C_IMP_LEV_L_IMPERSONATE, NULL, EOAC_DYNAMIC_CLOAKING, NULL)))
{
  IGlobalOptions *pGlobalOptions;
  hr = CoCreateInstance(CLSID_GlobalOptions, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;pGlobalOptions));
  if(SUCCEEDED(hr))
  {
    hr = pGlobalOptions-&gt;Set(COMGLB_EXCEPTION_HANDLING, COMGLB_EXCEPTION_DONOT_HANDLE);
    pGlobalOptions-&gt;Release();
  }
}
</code></pre>There are two additional functions that could be swallowing exceptions in your program: <code>_CrtSetReportHook2</code> and <code>SetUnhandledExceptionFilter</code>, but both of these are for SEH or C++ exceptions, and I was throwing an assertion, not an exception. I was actually able to verify, by replacing the assertion <code>#define</code> with my own version, that throwing an actual C++ exception <em>did</em> crash the program&mldr; but an assertion didn't. Specifically, an assertion calls <code>abort()</code>, which raises <code>SIGABRT</code>, which crashes any normal program. However, it turns out that Windows was eating the abort signal, along with every other signal I attempted to raise, which is a problem, because half the library is written in C, and C obviously can't raise C++ exceptions. The assertion failure even showed up in the output&mldr; but didn't crash the program!<pre class=language-cil><code>Assertion failed!

Program: ...udio 2015\\Projects\\feathergui\\bin\\fgDirect2D_d.dll
File: fgEffectBase.cpp
Line: 20

Expression: sizeof(_constants) == sizeof(float)_(4_4 + 2)
</code></pre>No matter what I do, Windows refuses to let the assertion failure crash the program, or even trigger a breakpoint in the debugger. In fact, calling the <code>__debugbreak()</code> intrinsic, which outputs an <code>int 3</code> CPU instruction, was <em>completely ignored</em>, as if it simply didn't exist. The only reliable way to actually crash the program without using C++ exceptions was to do something like divide by 0, or attempt to write to a null pointer, which triggers a segfault.</p><p>Any good developer should be using assertions to verify their assumptions, so having assertions silently fail and then <em>corrupt the program</em> is even worse than ignoring they exist! Now you could have an assertion in your code that's firing, terminating that callback, leaving your program in a broken state, and then the next message that's processed blows up for strange and bizarre reasons that make no sense because they're impossible.</p><p>I have a hard enough time getting my programs to <em>work</em>, I didn't think it'd be this hard to make them <em>crash</em>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-02-13T21:33:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/windows-wont-let-my-program-crash/>February 13, 2017 at 9:33pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/windows-wont-let-my-program-crash/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-wont-let-my-program-crash%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Windows%20Won%27t%20Let%20My%20Program%20Crash&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-wont-let-my-program-crash%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwindows-wont-let-my-program-crash%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/directx-is-terrifying/>DirectX Is Terrifying</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>About two months ago, I got a new laptop and proceeded to load all my projects on it. Despite compiling everything fine, my graphics engine that used DirectX mysteriously crashed upon running. I immediately suspected either a configuration issue or a driver issue, but this seemed weird because my laptop had a <em>newer</em> graphics card than my desktop. Why was it crashing on <em>newer</em> hardware? Things got even more bizarre once I narrowed down the issue - it was in my shader assignment code, which hadn't been touched in almost 2 years. While I initially suspected a shader compilation issue, there was no such error in the logs. All the shaders compiled fine, and then&mldr; didn't work.</p><p>Now, if this error had also been happening on my desktop, I would have immediately started digging through my constant assignments, followed by the vertex buffers assigned to the shader, but again, all of this ran perfectly fine on my desktop. I was completely baffled as to why things weren't working properly. I had eliminated all possible errors I could think of that would have resulted from moving the project from my desktop to my laptop: none of the media files were missing, all the shaders compiled, all the relative paths were correct, I was using the exact same compiler as before with all the appropriate updates. I even updated drivers on both computers, but it stubbornly refused to work on the laptop while running fine on the desktop.</p><p>Then I found something that nearly made me shit my pants.<pre class=language-cpp><code>if(profile &lt;= VERTEX_SHADER_5_0 &amp;&amp; _lastVS != shader) {
  //...
} else if(profile &lt;= PIXEL_SHADER_5_0 &amp;&amp; _lastPS != shader) { 
  //...
} else if(profile &lt;= GEOMETRY_SHADER_5_0 &amp;&amp; _lastGS != shader) {
  //...
}</code></pre>Like any sane graphics engine, I do some very simple caching by keeping track of the last shader I assigned and only setting the shader if it had actually changed. These if statements, however, have a very stupid but subtle bug that took me quite a while to catch. They're a standard range exclusion chain that figures out what type of shader a given shader version is. If it's less than say, 5, it's a vertex shader. Otherwise, if it's less than 10, that this means it's in the range 5-10 and is a pixel shader. Otherwise, if it's less than 15, it must be in the range 10-15, ad infinitum. The idea is that you don't need to check if the value is greater than 5 because the failure of the previous statement already implies that. However, adding that cache check on the end breaks all of this, because now you could be in the range 0-5, but the cache check could fail, throwing you down to the next statement checking to see if you're below 10. Because you're in the range 0-5, you're of course below 10, and the cache check will ALWAYS succeed, because no vertex shader would ever be in the pixel shader cache! <strong>All my vertex shaders were being sent in to directX as pixel shaders after their initial assignment!</strong></p><p>For almost 2 years, I had been feeding DirectX <em>total bullshit</em>, and had even tested it on multiple other computers, and it had never given me a single warning, error, crash, or any indication whatsoever that my code was <strong>completely fucking broken</strong>, in either debug mode or release mode. Somehow, deep in the depths of nVidia's insane DirectX driver, it had managed to detect that I had just tried to assign a vertex shader to a pixel shader, and either ignored it completely, or silently fixed my catastrophic fuckup. However, my laptop had the <em>mobile</em> drivers, which for some reason did not include this failsafe, and so it actually crashed like it was supposed to.</p><p>While this was an <em>incredibly</em> stupid bug that I must have written while sleep deprived or drunk (which is impressive, because I don't actually drink), it was simply impossible for me to catch because it produced <em>zero errors or warnings</em>. As a result, this bug has the honor of being both the dumbest and the longest-living bug of mine, <em>ever</em>. I've checked every location I know of for any indication that anything was wrong, including hooking into the debug log of directX and dumping all it's messages. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zero.</p><p>I've heard stories about the insane bullshit nVidia's drivers do, but this is <strong>fucking terrifying</strong>.</p><p>Alas, there is more. I had been experimenting with direct2D as an alternative because, well, it's a 2D engine, right? After getting text rendering working, a change in string caching suddenly broke the entire program. It broke in a particularly bizarre way, because it seemed to just stop rendering halfway through the scene. It took almost an hour of debugging for me to finally confirm that the moment I was rendering a particular text string, the direct2D driver just <em>stopped</em>. No errors were thrown. No warnings could be found. Direct2D's failure state was apparently to simply make every single function call silently fail with no indication that it was failing in the first place. It didn't even tell me that the device was missing or that I needed to recreate it. The text render call was made and then every single subsequent call was ignored and the backbuffer was forever frozen to that half-drawn frame.</p><p>The error itself didn't seem to make any more sense, either. I was passing a perfectly valid string to Direct2D, but because that string originated in a <em>different DLL</em>, it apparently made Direct2D completely shit itself. Copying the string onto the stack, however, worked (which itself could only work if the original string was valid).</p><p>The cherry on top of all this is when I discovered that Direct2D's matrix rotation constructor takes <strong>degrees</strong>, not radians, like <em>every single other mathematical function in the standard library.</em> <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb205362(v=vs.85).aspx">Even DirectX takes radians!</a></p><p><em><strong>WHO WRITES THESE APIs?!</strong></em></p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-02-01T19:35:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/directx-is-terrifying/>February 1, 2017 at 7:35pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/directx-is-terrifying/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdirectx-is-terrifying%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=DirectX%20Is%20Terrifying&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdirectx-is-terrifying%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdirectx-is-terrifying%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/our-software-is-beacon-of-hope/>Our Software Is a Beacon of Hope</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>As I draw closer to releasing the first early alpha of a library I've been working on for several years, I've noticed that it's release time coincides with some rather depressing politics that I wish I could ignore. Unfortunately, it's difficult to ignore politicians who seek to destroy the lives of your closest friends. A common theme I hear from my friends is a feeling of helplessness, as though we all know terrible things are happening, but no one really knows what to do about it.</p><p>But we are not helpless. It is so easy to lose ourselves in pessimism and cynicism, to think that everything will continue to be shit simply because it's been shit for so many years. A common refrain I heard while still working at a large corporation was, <em>we know our code is shit, but it's okay, because everyone else's code is shit</em>. This kind of mentality really bothers me, not because it isn't true, but because it seems to reflect a resigned, cynical view of the world, and never strives to do better. Yes, everything might end up being shit in the end, but if we don't even attempt to build something better, we never will. If we hadn't been trying to write better code we never would have invented structured programming, or object oriented programming, or functional programming. Each innovation builds on the last, and each innovation has it's faults, but each brings us one step closer to not being shit.</p><p>What disturbs me is that the software industry's inability to strive for better code now mirrors a feeling of political resignation, a malaise that seems to be settling on our polarized political discourse. If democracy isn't working, what else can we do? If the entire system is corrupt, what hope do we have of fixing it? As wealth inequality rises to <a href=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/worlds-8-richest-men-are-worth-as-much-as-3-6-billion-people-davos-world-economic-forum/>ever more absurd levels</a>, our society is tumbling towards a breaking point. Just like a badly maintained software stack, our society is threatening to topple over under economic stresses it was never built to handle. How much longer can we keep it running with duct-tape and terrible hacks? It is our duty to push for real change, to build a better foundation for our future using whatever skills or resources we have.</p><p>As I prepare my library for its initial release, I'm not just zipping up a bunch of files to upload to GitHub. I'm lighting a fire, a beacon of hope that I will cast out into the endless night, praying that it might lead us to a brighter future. I am joined by millions of other flickering flames, many of which will fade with time. A few, however, will grow brighter and brighter, until they bring forth a new dawn and shepherd us into a bright new future, even if only for a moment, before sinking below the horizon. Our entire society is built on these brief moments of clarity. Some are longer than others, but all are important. Even when the night seems to stretch on without end, the rays of hope from a thousand stars can still point us in the right direction.</p><p>We all wish for a brighter future, a future free from disease and poverty and war and hunger. We seek the future that we envision for ourselves in our stories and movies. Sometimes, it seems like society is going backwards, when everything is going wrong and nothing seems to go right for anyone. But it is in these moments that we must not forget the most important thing: we cannot wait for the future to come to us, we must build it ourselves. 2016 was not a very good year for many people. 2017 shows signs of being even worse, but I don't care.</p><p>I'm going to <em>make</em> 2017 be a better year. I'm going to <em>make</em> the future I want to live in. I'm going to <em>build</em> the tools I wish I had. We are not pawns in some cosmic game, we are human beings. We are free agents capable of making our own decisions, and I'm making a decision to make the future happen, whether it wants to or not.</p><p>I'm not letting this year take me down without a fight.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2017-01-17T14:35:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/our-software-is-beacon-of-hope/>January 17, 2017 at 2:35pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/our-software-is-beacon-of-hope/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2four-software-is-beacon-of-hope%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Our%20Software%20Is%20a%20Beacon%20of%20Hope&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2four-software-is-beacon-of-hope%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2four-software-is-beacon-of-hope%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/everyone-does-srgb-wrong-because/>Everyone Does sRGB Wrong Because Everyone Else Does sRGB Wrong</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Did you know that CSS3 does all its linear gradients and color interpolation completely wrong? All color values in CSS3 are in the sRGB color space, because that's the color space that gets displayed on our monitor. However, the problem is that the sRGB color space looks like this:</p><p><center><a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/SRGB_gamma.svg/250px-SRGB_gamma.svg.png target=_blank><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/SRGB_gamma.svg/250px-SRGB_gamma.svg.png alt="sRGB gamma curve"></a></center></p><p>Trying to do a linear interpolation along a nonlinear curve doesn't work very well. Instead, you're supposed to linearize your color values, transforming the sRGB curve to the linear RGB curve before doing your operation, and then transforming it back into the sRGB curve. This is gamma correction. Here are comparisons between gradients, transitions, alpha blending, and image resizing done directly in sRGB space (assuming your browser complies with the W3C spec) versus in linear RGB:</p><p><table style="margin:0 auto"><tr><th>sRGB</th><th>Linear</th></tr><tr><td><div style="background:linear-gradient( 0deg,#FF0000,#00FF00);width:100px;height:100px"></div></td><td style=vertical-align:center><img src=/img/srgb_gradient.png style=padding:0;border:0></td></tr><tr><td><div id=srgbani style=background:red;width:100px;height:100px></div></td><td><div id=linearani style=background:red;width:100px;height:100px></div></td></tr><tr><td><img src=/img/srgb_radial.png style=background:red;width:100px;height:100px;margin:0;padding:0;border:0></td><td><img src=/img/srgb_alpha.png style=padding:0;border:0></td></tr><tr><td><img src=/img/srgb_resize.png style=padding:0;border:0 height=100 width=100></td><td><img src=/img/srgb_resize_correct.png style="padding:0;height=" 100" width=100></td></tr></table>At this point you've probably seen a bazillion posts about how you're doing color interpolation wrong, or gradients wrong, or alpha blending wrong, and the reason is because&mldr; you're doing it wrong. But one can hardly blame you, because <strong>everyone</strong> is doing it wrong. CSS does it wrong because SVG does it wrong because Photoshop does it wrong because everyone else does it wrong. It's all wrong.</p><p>The amazing thing here is that the W3C is <a href=https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Jan/0635.html>entirely aware of how wrong CSS3 linear gradients are</a>, but did it anyway to be consistent with everything else that does them wrong. It's interesting that while SVG is wrong by default, it <em>does</em> provide a way to fix this, via <code>color-interpolation</code>. Of course, CSS doesn't have this property yet, so literally all gradients and transitions on the web are wrong because there is no other choice. Even if CSS provided a way to fix this, it would still have to default to being wrong.</p><p>It seems we have reached a point where, after years of doing sRGB interpolation incorrectly, we continue to do it wrong not because we don't know better, but because everyone else is doing it wrong. So everyone's doing it wrong because everyone else is doing it wrong. A single bad choice done long ago has locked us into <strong>compatibility hell</strong>. We got it wrong the first time so now we have to keep getting it wrong because everyone expects the wrong result.</p><p>It doesn't help that we don't always necessarily <em>want</em> the correct interpolation. The reason direct interpolation in sRGB is wrong is because it changes the perceived luminosity. Notice that when going from red to green, the sRGB gradient gets darker in the middle of the transition, while the gamma-corrected one has constant perceived luminosity. However, an artist may prefer the sRGB curve to the linearized one because it puts more emphasis on red and green. This problem gets worse when artists use toolchains inside sRGB and unknowingly compensate for any gamma errors such that the result is roughly what one would expect. This is a particular issue in games, because games really do need gamma-correct lighting pipelines, but the GUIs were often built using incorrect sRGB interpolation, so doing gamma-correct alpha blending gives you the wrong result because the alpha values were already chosen to compensate for incorrect blending.</p><p>In short, this is quite a mess we've gotten ourselves into, but I think the most important thing we can do is give people the <em>option</em> of having a gamma correct pipeline. It is not difficult to selectively blend things with proper gamma correction. We need to have things like SVG's <code>color-interpolation</code> property in CSS, and other software needs to provide optional gamma correct pipelines (I'm looking at you, photoshop).</p><p>Maybe, eventually, we can dig ourselves out of this sRGB hell we've gotten ourselves into.</p><script>function decimalToHex(d){var hex=Math.floor(d).toString(16);hex="000000".substr(0,6-hex.length)+hex;return hex;}var start=null;function fromlinear(x){return(x<=0.0031308)?(x*12.92):(1.055*Math.pow(x,1/2.4))-0.055;}function transitionlinear(x){if(!start)start=x;var delta=x-start;var v=document.getElementById("srgbani");var v2=document.getElementById("linearani");var p=(delta*0.0005)%1.0;v.style.backgroundColor="#"+decimalToHex(Math.floor(p*256)*256+Math.floor((1-p)*256)*256*256);v2.style.backgroundColor="#"+decimalToHex(Math.floor(fromlinear(p)*256)*256+Math.floor(fromlinear(1-p)*256)*256*256);window.requestAnimationFrame(transitionlinear);}window.requestAnimationFrame(transitionlinear);</script></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2016-12-20T15:26:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/everyone-does-srgb-wrong-because/>December 20, 2016 at 3:26pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/everyone-does-srgb-wrong-because/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-does-srgb-wrong-because%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Everyone%20Does%20sRGB%20Wrong%20Because%20Everyone%20Else%20Does%20sRGB%20Wrong&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-does-srgb-wrong-because%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-does-srgb-wrong-because%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/mathematical-notation-is-awful/>Mathematical Notation Is Awful</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Today, a friend asked me for help figuring out how to calculate the standard deviation over a discrete probability distribution. I pulled up <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/course-notes/>my notes from college</a> and was able to correctly calculate the standard deviation they had been unable to derive after hours upon hours of searching the internet and trying to piece together poor explanations from questionable sources. The crux of the problem was, as I had suspected, the astonishingly bad notation involved with this particular calculation. You see, the expected value of a given distribution <span class=math>$$ X $$</span> is expressed as <span class=math>$$ E[X] $$</span>, which is calculated using the following formula:<div class=math>\[ E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} x_i p(x_i) \]</div>The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and the variance is given in terms of the expected value.<div class=math>\[ Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \]</div>Except that <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> is of course completely different from <span class=math>$$ (E[X])^2 $$</span>, but it gets worse, because <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> makes <em>no notational sense whatsoever</em>. In any other function, in math, doing <span class=math>$$ f(x^2) $$</span> means going through and substitution <span class=math>$$ x $$</span> with <span class=math>$$ x^2 $$</span>. In this case, however, <span class=math>$$ E[X] $$</span> actually doesn't have anything to do with the resulting equation, because <span class=math>$$ X \neq x_i $$</span>, and as a result, the equation for <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> is this:<div class=math>\[ E[X^2] = \sum_i x_i^2 p(x_i) \]</div>Only the first <span class=math>$$ x_i $$</span> is squared. <span class=math>$$ p(x_i) $$</span> isn't, because it doesn't make any sense in the first place. It should really be just <span class=math>$$ P_{Xi} $$</span> or something, because it's a <em>discrete value</em>, not a function! It would also explain why the <span class=math>$$ x_i $$</span> inside <span class=math>$$ p() $$</span> isn't squared - because it <em>doesn't even exist</em>, it's just a gross abuse of notation. This situation is so bloody confusing I even explicitely laid out the equation for <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> in my own notes, presumably to prevent me from trying to figure out what the hell was going on in the middle of my final.</p><p>That, however, was only the beginning. Another question required them to find the covariance between two seperate discrete distributions, <span class=math>$$ X $$</span> and <span class=math>$$ Y $$</span>. I have never actually done covariance, so my notes were of no help here, and I was forced to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance>return to wikipedia</a>, which gives this helpful equation.<div class=math>\[ cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] \]</div>Oh shit. I've already established that <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> is impossible to determine because the notation doesn't rely on any obvious rules, which means that <span class=math>$$ E[XY] $$</span> could evaluate to <em>god knows what</em>. Luckily, wikipedia has an alternative calculation method:<div class=math>\[ cov(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - E(X))(y_i - E(Y)) \]</div>This almost works, except for two problems. One, <span class=math>$$ \frac{1}{n} $$</span> doesn't actually work because we have a nonuniform discrete probability distribution, so we have to substitute multiplying in the probability mass function <span class=math>$$ p(x_i,y_i) $$</span> instead. Two, wikipedia refers to <span class=math>$$ E(X) $$</span> and <span class=math>$$ E(Y) $$</span> as the <strong>means</strong>, not the expected value. This gets even more confusing because, at the beginning of the Wikipedia article, it used brackets (<span class=math>$$ E[X] $$</span>), and now it's using parenthesis (<span class=math>$$ E(X) $$</span>). Is that the same value? Is it something completely different? Calling it the mean would be confusing because the average of a given data set isn't necessarily the same as finding what the average <em>expected value</em> of a probability distribution is, which is why we call it the <em>expected value</em>. But naturally, I quickly discovered that <strong>yes</strong>, the mean and the average and the expected value are all <strong>exactly the same thing!</strong> Also, I still don't know why Wikipedia suddenly switched to <span class=math>$$ E(X) $$</span> instead of <span class=math>$$ E[X] $$</span> because it stills means <em>the exact same goddamn thing</em>.</p><p>We're up to, what, five different ways of saying <em>the same thing?</em> At least, I'm assuming it's the same thing, but there could be some incredibly subtle distinction between the two that nobody ever explains anywhere except in some academic paper locked up behind a paywall that was published 30 years ago, because apparently mathematicians are okay with this.</p><p>Even then, this is just <em>one instance</em> where the ambiguity and redundancy in our mathematical notation has caused enormous confusion. I find it particularly telling that the most difficult part about figuring out any mathematical equation for me is usually to simply figure out what all the goddamn notation even <em>means</em>, because usually most of it isn't explained at all. Do you know how many ways we have of taking the derivative of something?</p><p><span class=math>$$ f'(x) $$</span> is the same as <span class=math>$$ \frac{dy}{dx} $$</span> or <span class=math>$$ \frac{df}{dx} $$</span> even <span class=math>$$ \frac{d}{dx}f(x) $$</span> which is the same as <span class=math>$$ \dot x $$</span> which is the same as <span class=math>$$ Df $$</span> which is technically the same as <span class=math>$$ D_xf(x) $$</span> and also <span class=math>$$ D_xy $$</span> which is also the same as <span class=math>$$ f_x(x) $$</span> provided x is the only variable, because taking the partial derivative of a function with only one variable is the exact same as taking the derivative in the first place, and I've actually seen math papers abuse this fact instead of use some other sane notation for the derivative. And that's just for the derivative!</p><p>Don't even get me started on multiplication, where we use <span class=math>$$ 2 \times 2 $$</span> in elementary school, <span class=math>$$ * $$</span> on computers, but use <span class=math>$$ \cdot $$</span> or simply stick two things next to each other in traditional mathematics. Not only is using <span class=math>$$ \times $$</span> confusing as a multiplicative operator when you have <span class=math>$$ x $$</span> floating around, but it's a <em>real operator!</em> It means <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product>cross product</a> in vector analysis. Of course, the <span class=math>$$ \cdot $$</span> also doubles as meaning the Dot Product, which is at least nominally acceptable since a dot product does reduce to a simple multiplication of scalar values. The Outer Product is generally given as <span class=math>$$ \otimes $$</span>, unless you're in Geometric Algebra, in which case it's given by <span class=math>$$ \wedge $$</span>, which of course means <strong>AND</strong> in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction>binary logic</a>. Geometric Algebra then re-uses the cross product symbol <span class=math>$$ \times $$</span> to instead mean <em>commutator product</em>, and also defines the <em>regressive product</em> as the dual of the outer product, which uses <span class=math>$$ \nabla $$</span>. This conflicts with the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient>gradient operator</a> in multivariable calculus, which uses the exact same symbol in a totally different context, and just for fun it also defined <span class=math>$$ * $$</span> as the &ldquo;scalar&rdquo; product, just to make sure every possible operator has been violently hijacked to mean something completely unexpected.</p><p>This is just <em>one area</em> of mathematics - it is common for many different subfields of math to redefine operators into their own meaning and god forbid any of these fields actually come into contact with each other because then no one knows what the hell is going on. Math is a language that is about as consistent as English, and that's on a good day.</p><p>I am sick and tired of people complaining that nobody likes math when they refuse to admit that mathematical notation sucks, and is a major roadblock for many students. It is useful only for advanced mathematics that take place in university graduate programs and research laboratories. It's hard enough to teach people calculus, let alone expose them to something useful like statistical analysis or matrix algebra that is relevant in our modern world when the notation looks like Greek and makes about as much sense as the English pronunciation rules. We simply cannot introduce people to advanced math by writing a bunch of incoherent equations on a whiteboard. We need to find a way to separate the underlying mathematical <em>concepts</em> from the arcane scribbles we force students to deal with.</p><p>Personally, I understand most of higher math by reformulating it in terms of lambda calculus and type theory, because they map to real world programs I can write and investigate and <em>explore</em>. Interpreting mathematical concepts in terms of computer programs is just one way to make math more tangible. There must be other ways we can explain math without having to explain the extraordinarily dense, outdated notation that we use.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2016-07-30T22:18:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/mathematical-notation-is-awful/>July 30, 2016 at 10:18pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/mathematical-notation-is-awful/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;11 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmathematical-notation-is-awful%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mathematical%20Notation%20Is%20Awful&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmathematical-notation-is-awful%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmathematical-notation-is-awful%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><div class=pager><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/6>Newer</a></li><li style=text-align:center><a href=/blog/>Home</a></li><li style=text-align:right><a href=/blog/page/8>Older</a></li></ul></div></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</a></li><li><a href=/blog/age-of-bullshit/>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</a></li><li><a href=/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
