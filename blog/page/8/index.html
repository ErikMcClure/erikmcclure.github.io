All color values in CSS3 are in the sRGB color space, because that's the color space that gets displayed on our monitor. However, the problem is that the sRGB color space looks like this:</p><p><center><a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/SRGB_gamma.svg/250px-SRGB_gamma.svg.png target=_blank><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/SRGB_gamma.svg/250px-SRGB_gamma.svg.png alt="sRGB gamma curve"></a></center></p><p>Trying to do a linear interpolation along a nonlinear curve doesn't work very well. Instead, you're supposed to linearize your color values, transforming the sRGB curve to the linear RGB curve before doing your operation, and then transforming it back into the sRGB curve. This is gamma correction. Here are comparisons between gradients, transitions, alpha blending, and image resizing done directly in sRGB space (assuming your browser complies with the W3C spec) versus in linear RGB:</p><p><table style="margin:0 auto"><tr><th>sRGB</th><th>Linear</th></tr><tr><td><div style="background:linear-gradient( 0deg,#FF0000,#00FF00);width:100px;height:100px"></div></td><td style=vertical-align:center><img src=/img/srgb_gradient.png style=padding:0;border:0></td></tr><tr><td><div id=srgbani style=background:red;width:100px;height:100px></div></td><td><div id=linearani style=background:red;width:100px;height:100px></div></td></tr><tr><td><img src=/img/srgb_radial.png style=background:red;width:100px;height:100px;margin:0;padding:0;border:0></td><td><img src=/img/srgb_alpha.png style=padding:0;border:0></td></tr><tr><td><img src=/img/srgb_resize.png style=padding:0;border:0 height=100 width=100></td><td><img src=/img/srgb_resize_correct.png style="padding:0;height=" 100" width=100></td></tr></table>At this point you've probably seen a bazillion posts about how you're doing color interpolation wrong, or gradients wrong, or alpha blending wrong, and the reason is because&mldr; you're doing it wrong. But one can hardly blame you, because <strong>everyone</strong> is doing it wrong. CSS does it wrong because SVG does it wrong because Photoshop does it wrong because everyone else does it wrong. It's all wrong.</p><p>The amazing thing here is that the W3C is <a href=https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Jan/0635.html>entirely aware of how wrong CSS3 linear gradients are</a>, but did it anyway to be consistent with everything else that does them wrong. It's interesting that while SVG is wrong by default, it <em>does</em> provide a way to fix this, via <code>color-interpolation</code>. Of course, CSS doesn't have this property yet, so literally all gradients and transitions on the web are wrong because there is no other choice. Even if CSS provided a way to fix this, it would still have to default to being wrong.</p><p>It seems we have reached a point where, after years of doing sRGB interpolation incorrectly, we continue to do it wrong not because we don't know better, but because everyone else is doing it wrong. So everyone's doing it wrong because everyone else is doing it wrong. A single bad choice done long ago has locked us into <strong>compatibility hell</strong>. We got it wrong the first time so now we have to keep getting it wrong because everyone expects the wrong result.</p><p>It doesn't help that we don't always necessarily <em>want</em> the correct interpolation. The reason direct interpolation in sRGB is wrong is because it changes the perceived luminosity. Notice that when going from red to green, the sRGB gradient gets darker in the middle of the transition, while the gamma-corrected one has constant perceived luminosity. However, an artist may prefer the sRGB curve to the linearized one because it puts more emphasis on red and green. This problem gets worse when artists use toolchains inside sRGB and unknowingly compensate for any gamma errors such that the result is roughly what one would expect. This is a particular issue in games, because games really do need gamma-correct lighting pipelines, but the GUIs were often built using incorrect sRGB interpolation, so doing gamma-correct alpha blending gives you the wrong result because the alpha values were already chosen to compensate for incorrect blending.</p><p>In short, this is quite a mess we've gotten ourselves into, but I think the most important thing we can do is give people the <em>option</em> of having a gamma correct pipeline. It is not difficult to selectively blend things with proper gamma correction. We need to have things like SVG's <code>color-interpolation</code> property in CSS, and other software needs to provide optional gamma correct pipelines (I'm looking at you, photoshop).</p><p>Maybe, eventually, we can dig ourselves out of this sRGB hell we've gotten ourselves into.</p><script>function decimalToHex(d){var hex=Math.floor(d).toString(16);hex="000000".substr(0,6-hex.length)+hex;return hex;}var start=null;function fromlinear(x){return(x<=0.0031308)?(x*12.92):(1.055*Math.pow(x,1/2.4))-0.055;}function transitionlinear(x){if(!start)start=x;var delta=x-start;var v=document.getElementById("srgbani");var v2=document.getElementById("linearani");var p=(delta*0.0005)%1.0;v.style.backgroundColor="#"+decimalToHex(Math.floor(p*256)*256+Math.floor((1-p)*256)*256*256);v2.style.backgroundColor="#"+decimalToHex(Math.floor(fromlinear(p)*256)*256+Math.floor(fromlinear(1-p)*256)*256*256);window.requestAnimationFrame(transitionlinear);}window.requestAnimationFrame(transitionlinear);</script></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2016-12-20T15:26:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/everyone-does-srgb-wrong-because/>December 20, 2016 at 3:26pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/everyone-does-srgb-wrong-because/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-does-srgb-wrong-because%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Everyone%20Does%20sRGB%20Wrong%20Because%20Everyone%20Else%20Does%20sRGB%20Wrong&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-does-srgb-wrong-because%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2feveryone-does-srgb-wrong-because%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/mathematical-notation-is-awful/>Mathematical Notation Is Awful</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Today, a friend asked me for help figuring out how to calculate the standard deviation over a discrete probability distribution. I pulled up <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/course-notes/>my notes from college</a> and was able to correctly calculate the standard deviation they had been unable to derive after hours upon hours of searching the internet and trying to piece together poor explanations from questionable sources. The crux of the problem was, as I had suspected, the astonishingly bad notation involved with this particular calculation. You see, the expected value of a given distribution <span class=math>$$ X $$</span> is expressed as <span class=math>$$ E[X] $$</span>, which is calculated using the following formula:<div class=math>\[ E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} x_i p(x_i) \]</div>The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and the variance is given in terms of the expected value.<div class=math>\[ Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \]</div>Except that <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> is of course completely different from <span class=math>$$ (E[X])^2 $$</span>, but it gets worse, because <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> makes <em>no notational sense whatsoever</em>. In any other function, in math, doing <span class=math>$$ f(x^2) $$</span> means going through and substitution <span class=math>$$ x $$</span> with <span class=math>$$ x^2 $$</span>. In this case, however, <span class=math>$$ E[X] $$</span> actually doesn't have anything to do with the resulting equation, because <span class=math>$$ X \neq x_i $$</span>, and as a result, the equation for <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> is this:<div class=math>\[ E[X^2] = \sum_i x_i^2 p(x_i) \]</div>Only the first <span class=math>$$ x_i $$</span> is squared. <span class=math>$$ p(x_i) $$</span> isn't, because it doesn't make any sense in the first place. It should really be just <span class=math>$$ P_{Xi} $$</span> or something, because it's a <em>discrete value</em>, not a function! It would also explain why the <span class=math>$$ x_i $$</span> inside <span class=math>$$ p() $$</span> isn't squared - because it <em>doesn't even exist</em>, it's just a gross abuse of notation. This situation is so bloody confusing I even explicitely laid out the equation for <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> in my own notes, presumably to prevent me from trying to figure out what the hell was going on in the middle of my final.</p><p>That, however, was only the beginning. Another question required them to find the covariance between two seperate discrete distributions, <span class=math>$$ X $$</span> and <span class=math>$$ Y $$</span>. I have never actually done covariance, so my notes were of no help here, and I was forced to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance>return to wikipedia</a>, which gives this helpful equation.<div class=math>\[ cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] \]</div>Oh shit. I've already established that <span class=math>$$ E[X^2] $$</span> is impossible to determine because the notation doesn't rely on any obvious rules, which means that <span class=math>$$ E[XY] $$</span> could evaluate to <em>god knows what</em>. Luckily, wikipedia has an alternative calculation method:<div class=math>\[ cov(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - E(X))(y_i - E(Y)) \]</div>This almost works, except for two problems. One, <span class=math>$$ \frac{1}{n} $$</span> doesn't actually work because we have a nonuniform discrete probability distribution, so we have to substitute multiplying in the probability mass function <span class=math>$$ p(x_i,y_i) $$</span> instead. Two, wikipedia refers to <span class=math>$$ E(X) $$</span> and <span class=math>$$ E(Y) $$</span> as the <strong>means</strong>, not the expected value. This gets even more confusing because, at the beginning of the Wikipedia article, it used brackets (<span class=math>$$ E[X] $$</span>), and now it's using parenthesis (<span class=math>$$ E(X) $$</span>). Is that the same value? Is it something completely different? Calling it the mean would be confusing because the average of a given data set isn't necessarily the same as finding what the average <em>expected value</em> of a probability distribution is, which is why we call it the <em>expected value</em>. But naturally, I quickly discovered that <strong>yes</strong>, the mean and the average and the expected value are all <strong>exactly the same thing!</strong> Also, I still don't know why Wikipedia suddenly switched to <span class=math>$$ E(X) $$</span> instead of <span class=math>$$ E[X] $$</span> because it stills means <em>the exact same goddamn thing</em>.</p><p>We're up to, what, five different ways of saying <em>the same thing?</em> At least, I'm assuming it's the same thing, but there could be some incredibly subtle distinction between the two that nobody ever explains anywhere except in some academic paper locked up behind a paywall that was published 30 years ago, because apparently mathematicians are okay with this.</p><p>Even then, this is just <em>one instance</em> where the ambiguity and redundancy in our mathematical notation has caused enormous confusion. I find it particularly telling that the most difficult part about figuring out any mathematical equation for me is usually to simply figure out what all the goddamn notation even <em>means</em>, because usually most of it isn't explained at all. Do you know how many ways we have of taking the derivative of something?</p><p><span class=math>$$ f'(x) $$</span> is the same as <span class=math>$$ \frac{dy}{dx} $$</span> or <span class=math>$$ \frac{df}{dx} $$</span> even <span class=math>$$ \frac{d}{dx}f(x) $$</span> which is the same as <span class=math>$$ \dot x $$</span> which is the same as <span class=math>$$ Df $$</span> which is technically the same as <span class=math>$$ D_xf(x) $$</span> and also <span class=math>$$ D_xy $$</span> which is also the same as <span class=math>$$ f_x(x) $$</span> provided x is the only variable, because taking the partial derivative of a function with only one variable is the exact same as taking the derivative in the first place, and I've actually seen math papers abuse this fact instead of use some other sane notation for the derivative. And that's just for the derivative!</p><p>Don't even get me started on multiplication, where we use <span class=math>$$ 2 \times 2 $$</span> in elementary school, <span class=math>$$ * $$</span> on computers, but use <span class=math>$$ \cdot $$</span> or simply stick two things next to each other in traditional mathematics. Not only is using <span class=math>$$ \times $$</span> confusing as a multiplicative operator when you have <span class=math>$$ x $$</span> floating around, but it's a <em>real operator!</em> It means <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product>cross product</a> in vector analysis. Of course, the <span class=math>$$ \cdot $$</span> also doubles as meaning the Dot Product, which is at least nominally acceptable since a dot product does reduce to a simple multiplication of scalar values. The Outer Product is generally given as <span class=math>$$ \otimes $$</span>, unless you're in Geometric Algebra, in which case it's given by <span class=math>$$ \wedge $$</span>, which of course means <strong>AND</strong> in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction>binary logic</a>. Geometric Algebra then re-uses the cross product symbol <span class=math>$$ \times $$</span> to instead mean <em>commutator product</em>, and also defines the <em>regressive product</em> as the dual of the outer product, which uses <span class=math>$$ \nabla $$</span>. This conflicts with the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient>gradient operator</a> in multivariable calculus, which uses the exact same symbol in a totally different context, and just for fun it also defined <span class=math>$$ * $$</span> as the &ldquo;scalar&rdquo; product, just to make sure every possible operator has been violently hijacked to mean something completely unexpected.</p><p>This is just <em>one area</em> of mathematics - it is common for many different subfields of math to redefine operators into their own meaning and god forbid any of these fields actually come into contact with each other because then no one knows what the hell is going on. Math is a language that is about as consistent as English, and that's on a good day.</p><p>I am sick and tired of people complaining that nobody likes math when they refuse to admit that mathematical notation sucks, and is a major roadblock for many students. It is useful only for advanced mathematics that take place in university graduate programs and research laboratories. It's hard enough to teach people calculus, let alone expose them to something useful like statistical analysis or matrix algebra that is relevant in our modern world when the notation looks like Greek and makes about as much sense as the English pronunciation rules. We simply cannot introduce people to advanced math by writing a bunch of incoherent equations on a whiteboard. We need to find a way to separate the underlying mathematical <em>concepts</em> from the arcane scribbles we force students to deal with.</p><p>Personally, I understand most of higher math by reformulating it in terms of lambda calculus and type theory, because they map to real world programs I can write and investigate and <em>explore</em>. Interpreting mathematical concepts in terms of computer programs is just one way to make math more tangible. There must be other ways we can explain math without having to explain the extraordinarily dense, outdated notation that we use.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2016-07-30T22:18:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/mathematical-notation-is-awful/>July 30, 2016 at 10:18pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/mathematical-notation-is-awful/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;11 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmathematical-notation-is-awful%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mathematical%20Notation%20Is%20Awful&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmathematical-notation-is-awful%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fmathematical-notation-is-awful%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/the-gpl-is-usually-overkill/>The GPL Is Usually Overkill</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Something that really bothers me about the GPL and free software crusaders in general is that they don't seem to understand the nuances behind the problem they are attempting to solve. I'm not entirely sure they are even trying to solve the right problem in the first place.</p><p>The core issue at play here is <em>control</em>. In a world run by software, we need control over what code is being executed on our hardware. This issue is of paramount importance as we move into an age of autonomous vehicles and wearable devices. Cory Doctorow's brilliant essay, <a href=http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/lockdown.html>Lockdown: The coming war on general-purpose computing</a>, gives a detailed explanation of precisely <em>why</em> it is of such crucial importance that <em>you</em> have control over what software gets executed on your machine, and not some corporation. Are you really going to buy a car and then get into it when you have no way of controlling what it does? This isn't some desktop computer anymore, it's a machine that can decide whether you live or die.</p><p>It is completely true that, if everything was open source, we would then have total control over everything that is being run on our machines. However, proponents of open source software don't seem to realize that this is the <em>nuclear option</em>. Yes, it solves your problem, but it does so via massive overkill. There are much less extreme ways to achieve exactly what you want that don't involve requiring <em>literally everything</em> to be open source.</p><p>Our goal is to ensure that only trusted code is run on our machine. In order to achieve this goal, the firmware and operating system <strong>must be open source</strong>. This is because both the operating system and the firmware act as gatekeepers - if we have something like Intel's Trusted Execution Technology, we absolutely must have access to the firmware's source code, because it is the first link in our <em>trust chain</em>. If we can make the TXT engine work for <em>us</em>, we can use it to ensure that only operating systems we approve of can be run on our hardware.</p><p>We now reach the second stage of our trust chain. By using a boot-time validation of a cryptographic signature, we can verify that we are running an operating system of our choice. Because the operating system is what implements the necessary program isolation and protection mechanisms, it too is a required part of our trust chain and therefore <em>must be open source</em>. We also want the operating system to implement some form of permission restriction - ideally it would be like Android, except that <em>anything</em> running on the OS must explicitly tell you what resources it needs to access, not just apps you download from the store.</p><p>And&mldr; <em>that's it</em>. Most free software zealots that are already familiar with this chain of events would go on to say that you should only install open source software and whatever, but in reality this is unnecessary. You certainly want open source drivers, but once you have control over the firmware and the operating system, no program can be run without your permission. Any closed-source application can only do what I have given it permission to do. It could phone home without my knowledge or abuse the permissions I have granted it in other ways, but the hardware is still under my control. I can simply uninstall the application if I decide I don't like it. Applications cannot control my hardware unless I give them explicit permission to do so.</p><p>Is this enough? The FSF would argue that, no, it's not enough until your entire computer is running only open source code that can be verified and compiled by yourself, but I disagree. At some point, you have to trust <em>someone</em>, somewhere, as demonstrated by the <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack>Ken Thompson Hack</a>. I'm fine with trusting a corporation, but I need have total control over who I am trusting. If a corporation controls my firmware or my operating system, then <strong>they control who I trust</strong>. I can ask them politely to please trust or not trust some program, but I can't actually be sure of anything, because I do not control the root of the trust chain. <strong>Open source software is important for firmware and operating systems, because it's the only way to establish a chain of trust that you control</strong>. However, once I have an existing chain of trust, I don't need open-source programs anymore. <em>I now control what runs on my computer</em>. I can tell my computer to never run anything written by Oracle, and be assured that it will actually never trust anything written by Oracle.</p><p>If I sell you a piece of software, you have a right to decompile it, modify it, hack it, or uninstall it. This does not, however, require me to explain how it works to you, nor how to assemble it. If you trust me, you can run this piece of software on your hardware, but if you don't trust me, then a verifiable chain of trust will ensure that my software <em>never</em> runs on your machine. <em>This</em> is what matters. This is what having control means. It means being able to say what does or doesn't run on your computer. It does not require that everything is open source. It only requires an open source, verifiable chain of trust, and faith in whatever company made the software you've chosen to run. If a company's software is proprietary and they do something you don't like, <em>use something else</em>.</p><p>Open source code is important for <em>firmware and operating systems</em>, not <em>everything</em>.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2016-04-28T14:23:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-gpl-is-usually-overkill/>April 28, 2016 at 2:23pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/the-gpl-is-usually-overkill/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-gpl-is-usually-overkill%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20GPL%20Is%20Usually%20Overkill&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-gpl-is-usually-overkill%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-gpl-is-usually-overkill%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/the-right-to-ignore-difference-between/>The Right To Ignore: The Difference Between Free Speech And Harassment</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>On one hand, America was built on the values of <strong>free speech</strong>, which are obviously important. We cannot control what people are saying or our democracy falls apart. On the other hand, allowing <strong>harassment</strong> has a stifling effect on free speech, because it allows people to be bullied into silence. Before the internet, this distinction was fairly simple: Someone with a megaphone screaming hate speech in a park is exercising their right to free speech. Someone with a megaphone following a guy down the street is harassing them.</p><p>The arrival of the internet has made this line much more vague. However, the line between free speech and harassment is not nearly as blurry as some people might think. Our concept of <em>reasonable</em> freedom of speech is guided primarily by our <em>ability to ignore it</em>. The idea is, someone can go to a public park and say whatever they want, because other people can simply go somewhere else. As long as people have the ability to <em>ignore</em> whatever you're saying, you can say pretty much whatever you want. We have some additional controls on this for safety reasons, so you can't go to a park and talk about how you're going to kill all the gay people, tomorrow, with a shotgun, because that is a death threat.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the midst of defending free speech, a disturbing number of people have gotten it into their heads that other people <em>aren't allowed to ignore them</em>. <strong>This is harassment</strong>. The moment you take away someone's right to ignore what you are saying, you have crossed the line from free speech into harassment. Freedom of speech means that you have the right to say whatever you want, and <strong>everyone else has the right to ignore you</strong>. I'm not entirely sure <em>why</em> people think that free speech somehow lets them bypass blocking on a social network. Blocking people on the internet is what gives us our ability to ignore them. Blocking someone on the internet is the equivalent of walking away from some guy in the park who was yelling obscenities at you. If you bypass the blocking mechanism, this is basically <em>chasing them down as they run to their car, screaming your opinions at them with a megaphone</em>. Most societies think this is completely unacceptable behavior in real life, and it should be just as unacceptable on the internet.</p><p>On the other hand, <strong>enforcing political correctness is censorship</strong>. Political correctness is obviously something that should be <em>encouraged</em>, but enforcing it when someone is saying things you don't like in a public place is a <strong>clear violation of free speech</strong>. This is not a blurry line. This is not vague. If a Nazi supporter is saying how much they hate Jews, and they are not targeting this message at any one individual, <em>this is clearly protected free speech</em>. Now, if the Nazi is actually saying we should <em>murder</em> all of the Jews, this turns into hate speech because it is inciting violence against a group of people, and is restricted for the same safety reasons that prevent you from shouting &ldquo;FIRE!&rdquo; in a crowded movie theater.</p><p>Now, what if the Nazi supporter tells a <em>specific person</em> they are a dirty Jew? This gets into fuzzy territory. On one hand, we can say it isn't harassment so long as the targeted person can block the Nazi and the Nazi never attempts to circumvent this, or we can start classifying certain speech as being harassment if it is <em>ever</em> targeted at a specific individual. When we are debating what counts as harassment, <em>this</em> is the kind of stuff we should be debating. <em>This</em> is what society needs to figure out. Arguing that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj0hOTPob_LAhVM5GMKHeYmC4AQFggtMAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2015%2F06%2F12%2Ftwitter-free-speech%2F&usg=AFQjCNEMd-RJPwTUw4eB3Pl_uj-ZgY3SqQ&sig2=Wi4Jh0D0eOVwn51TC5RGqQ">mass-block lists on twitter are hurting free speech</a> is absurd. If someone wants to disregard everything you're saying because you happen to be walking past a group of Nazi supporters, <em>they have a right to do that</em>. If someone wants to ignore <em>everyone else on the planet</em>, they have a right to do that.</p><p>This kind of stuff is a problem when the vast majority of humanity uses a single <strong>private</strong> platform to espouse their opinions. Namely, Facebook. This is because Facebook has recently been <a href=http://www.vice.com/read/facebook-wont-let-faggots-say-faggot>banning people for saying faggot</a>, and because it's a private company, <em>this is completely legal</em>. This is also harmful to free speech. What appears to be happening is that websites, in an attempt to crack down on <em>harassment</em>, have instead accidentally started cracking down on <em>free speech</em> by outright banning people who say hateful things, instead of focusing on people who say hateful things <strong>to specific individuals</strong>.</p><p>Both sides of the debate are to blame for this. Extreme harassment on the internet has caused a backlash, resulting in a politically correct movement that calls for tempering all speech that might be even slightly offensive to anyone. In response, free speech advocates overreact and start attacking them by bypassing blocking mechanisms and <strong>harassing their members</strong>. This causes SJWs to overcompensate and start clamping down on <strong>all</strong> hateful speech, even hateful speech that is <strong>clearly protected free speech</strong> and has nothing to do with harassment. This just pisses off the free speech movement even more, causing them to oppose <em>any</em> restrictions on free speech, even reasonable ones. This just encourages SJWs to censor even more stuff in an endless spiral of aggression and escalation, until on one side, everyone is screaming obscenities and racial slurs in an incoherent cacophony, and on the other side, no one is saying anything at all.</p><p>If society is going to make any progress on this at all, we need to hammer out precisely what constitutes harassment and what is protected free speech. We need to make it absolutely clear that you can only harass an <em>individual</em>, and that <strong>everyone</strong> has the right to a block button. If a Nazi supporter starts screaming at you on twitter, you have the right to block him, and he has the right to block you. <strong>We cannot solve harassment with censorship</strong>. Instead of banning people we disagree with, we need to focus on building tools that let us ignore people we don't want to listen to. If you object to everyone blocking you because you use insulting racial epithets all the time, <em>maybe you should stop doing that</em>, and perhaps some of them might actually listen to you.</p><p>Of course, if you disagree with me, you are welcome to exercise your right to tell me exactly how much you hate my guts and want me to die in the comments section below, and I will exercise my right to completely ignore everything you say.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2016-03-13T21:27:00+00:00><i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/the-right-to-ignore-difference-between/>March 13, 2016 at 9:27pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/the-right-to-ignore-difference-between/#comments><i class="fa-regular fa-comments fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;4 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa-regular fa-share-square fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-right-to-ignore-difference-between%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Right%20To%20Ignore%3a%20The%20Difference%20Between%20Free%20Speech%20And%20Harassment&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-right-to-ignore-difference-between%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fthe-right-to-ignore-difference-between%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/there-will-never-be-one-true/>There Will Never Be One True Programming Language</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>A disturbing number of otherwise intelligent programmers seem to believe that, one day in the distant future, everyone will use the same magical programming language that solves everyone's problems at the same time.

Perhaps it would be some form of functional language, which the cool kids seem to think will save the entire software industry and make everything faster, better, more reliable and probably cure cancer in the process<sup><a href=#foot2>[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>But now, this same programming language that allows you to ignore the quantum computer must also be used to write it's own compiler that runs on&mldr; a quantum computer. So it needs to simultaneously be an elegant language for writing quantum programs. It also needs to be the perfect language for writing games and business applications and hypernet sites and machinery and brain implants and rocket trajectories and robot AI and planetary weather simulators and life support systems and hologram emittors and—</p><p>&mldr; Wouldn't it be a lot easier to just have domain-specific languages?</p><p>If you want to get technical, you can do all that with Lisp. It's just lambda calculus. It's also a <em>giant pain in the ass</em> when you use it for things that it was never meant for, like low level drivers or game development. You could try extending Lisp to better handle those edge-cases, and that's exactly what many lisp-derivatives do. The problem is that <strong>we will always be able to find new edge-cases</strong>. So, you would have to continue bolting things on to your magical language of ultimate power, playing a game of context-free whack-a-grammar for the rest of eternity.</p><p>This is ultimately doomed to fail, because it ignores the underlying purpose of programming languages: A programming language is a <strong>method of communication</strong>. Given two grammars, one that can do everything versus one that can do the one thing you're trying to do <em>really well</em>, which one are you going to pick for that particular project? Trying to get everyone to use the same language while they are trying to solve radically different problems is simply <em>bad engineering</em>. Do you <em>really</em> want to write your SQL queries using Lisp? You can only stuff so many tools into a swiss army knife before it becomes <a href=http://www.wengerna.com/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/a45137daa224e9531cb3050458faee64/image/wenger_giant_knife.png>completely impractical</a>.</p><p>Of course, a language that could do <em>everything</em> would also allow you to define any arbitrary new language within it, but this is equivalent to building an entire new language from scratch, because now everyone who wants to contribute to your project has to learn your unique grammar. However, having a common ground for different languages is a powerful tool, and we are headed in that direction with LLVM. You wouldn't want to write a program in LLVM, but it sure makes writing a compiler easier.</p><p>Instead of a future with one true programming language, perhaps we should be focused on a future with <strong>standard low-level assembly</strong>. A future with many different languages that can all talk to each other. A future where we don't <em>need</em> to argue about which programming language is the best, because every language could be used for whatever task it is best suited for, all in the same project. Different compilers could interpret the standard low-level assembly in their own ways, optimizing for different use-cases.</p><p>A universal standard for low-level assembly would <strong>solve everyth—</strong></p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:500px><a href=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png target=_blank><img src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png alt="mandatory xkcd" title="Mars insisted on making semicolons optional, which rendered their code completely incompatible with Earth's code.
