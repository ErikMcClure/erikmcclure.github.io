Because of the compounding effects involved, these types of games inevitably turn into a study of growth rates and how different functions interact. <a href=http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/>Cookie Clicker</a> is perhaps the most well-known, which employs an exponential growth curve for the costs of buildings that looks like this:</p><div class=math>\[ Cost_n = Cost_0\cdot 1.15^n \]</div><p>Where <span class=math>$$ Cost_0 $$</span> is the initial cost of the building. Each building, however, has a fixed income, and so the entire game is literally the player trying to purchase upgrades and buildings to fight against an interminable exponential growth curve of the cost function. Almost every single feature added to Cookie Clicker is yet another way to battle the growth rate of the exponential function, delaying the plateauing of the CPS as long as possible. This includes the reset functionality, which grants heavenly chips that yield large CPS bonuses. However, no feature can compensate for the fact that the buildings do not have a sufficient growth rate to keep up with the exponential cost function, so you inevitably wind up in a dead end where it becomes almost impossible to buy anything in a reasonable amount of time regardless of player action.</p><p>Pony Clicker is based off Cookie Clicker, but takes a different approach. Instead of having set rates for each building, each building generates a number of smiles based on the number of ponies and friendships that you have, along with other buildings that &ldquo;synergize&rdquo; with that building. The more expensive buildings generate more smiles because they have a higher growth rate than the buildings below them. This makes the game extremely difficult to balance, because you only have equations and the cost curves to work with, instead of simply being able to set the per-building SPS. Furthermore, the SPS of a building continues to grow and change over the course of the game, further complicating the balance equation. Unfortunately, in the first version of the game, the growth rate of the end building exceeded the growth rate of the cost function, which resulted in immense end-game instability and all around unhappiness. To address balance problems in pony clicker, rather than simply throwing ideas at the wall and trying to play test them infinitely, I wrote a program that played the game for me. It uses a nearly optimal strategy of buying whatever the most efficient building is in terms of cost per +1 SPS increase. This is not a perfectly optimal strategy, which has to take into account how long the next building will need to take, but it was pretty close to how players tended to play.</p><p>Using this, I could analyze a game of pony clicker in terms of what the SPS looked like over time. My first graph was not very promising:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7786493/21b10990-0188-11e5-86de-7eaa7d5e07d5.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7786493/21b10990-0188-11e5-86de-7eaa7d5e07d5.png width=100%></a></div><p>The SPS completely exploded and it was obviously terrible. To help me figure out what was going on, I included a graph of the optimal store purchases and the time until the next optimal purchase. My goal in terms of game experience was that no building would be left behind, and that there shouldn't be enormous gaps between purchases. I also wanted to make sure that the late game or the early game didn't take too long to get through.</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7786492/1ccd4ac4-0188-11e5-840b-d3a47f4a898a.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7786492/1ccd4ac4-0188-11e5-840b-d3a47f4a898a.png width=100%></a></div><p>In addition to this, I created a graph of the estimate SPS generation of each individual building, on a per-friendship basis. This helped compensate for the fact that the SPS changed as the game state itself changed, allowing me to ensure the SPS generation of any one building wasn't drastically out of whack with the others, and that it increased on a roughly linear scale.</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7787681/f5c01296-01cc-11e5-829e-a0e9e1f89334.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7787681/f5c01296-01cc-11e5-829e-a0e9e1f89334.png width=100%></a></div><p>This information was used to balance the game into a much more sane curve:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7899795/3bb8210c-06e7-11e5-9514-1b66669631dc.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7899795/3bb8210c-06e7-11e5-9514-1b66669631dc.png width=100%></a></div><p>I then added upgrades to the main graph, and quickly learned that I was giving the player certain upgrades way too fast:</p><div class=imgwrap style=max-width:700px><a href=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7806412/491fa6cc-0335-11e5-8e2e-6e6903d94240.png target=_blank><img src=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3387013/7806412/491fa6cc-0335-11e5-8e2e-6e6903d94240.png width=100%></a></div><p>This was used to balance the upgrades and ensure they only gave a significant SPS increase when it was really needed (between expensive buildings, usually). The analysis page itself is <a href=https://erikmcclure.github.io/PonyClicker/utilities/analysis.html>available here</a>, so you can look at the current state of pony clicker's growth curve.</p><p>These graphs might not be perfect, but they are incredibly helpful when you are trying to eliminate exponential explosions. If you got a value that spirals out of control, a graph will tell you <em>immediately</em>. It makes it very easy to quickly balance purchase prices, because you can adjust the prices and see how this affects the optimal gameplay curve. Pony Clicker had so many interacting equations it was basically the <em>only</em> way i could come up with a game that was even remotely balanced (although it still needs some work). It's a great example of how important <strong>rapid feedback</strong> is when designing something. If you can get immediate feedback on what changing something does, it makes the process of refining something much faster, which lets you do a better job of refining it. It also lets you experiment with things that would otherwise be way too complex to balance by hand.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2015-05-30T10:36:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/using-data-to-balance-your-game-pony/>May 30, 2015 at 10:36am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/using-data-to-balance-your-game-pony/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;4 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fusing-data-to-balance-your-game-pony%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Using%20Data%20To%20Balance%20Your%20Game%3a%20Pony%20Clicker%20Analysis&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fusing-data-to-balance-your-game-pony%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fusing-data-to-balance-your-game-pony%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/is-there-commercial-open-source-license/>Is There A Commercial Open Source License?</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Putting <em>Commercial</em> and <em>Open-Source</em> together is often considered an oxymoron. Part of this is caused by constant confusion between the terms Open-Source and Free Software, which is made even worse by people who have more liberal interpretations of the phrase &ldquo;Open-Source&rdquo;. In many cases, keeping the source code of a product proprietary serves no other purpose than to prevent people from stealing the product. Putting an application under the GPL and selling it is perfectly reasonable for software aimed at end-users, whom are unlikely to know how to compile the freely available source. Libraries aimed at developers, however, usually must resort to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing>Dual Licensing</a>.</p><p>To me, dual licensing is a bit of a hack job. Using two fundamentally incompatible licenses at the same time always rubbed me the wrong way, even if it's perfectly legal for the creator of the software. The other problem is that this is usually done via copyleft licenses, and I would prefer more permissive licenses, given that I only care about whether or not the result is commercial or not. This, however, turns out to be a bit of a problem.</p><p>My ideal license for a commercial library would state that anyone is free to modify, distribute, or use the source code in anything they want, provided the resulting source code retains the provided license. If the resulting product is strictly noncommercial, it would be free. If, however, the source code or any derivation of the source code is used in a commercial product, there would be a fee. It'd basically be an MIT license with an added fee for commercial derivative works, with additional restrictions on what commercial derivative works are allowed.</p><p>The problem is, even if I were to use a dual-licensing strategy, there is no open-source license that contains a noncommercial restriction, because <a href=http://opensource.org/docs/osd>this isn't open-source</a>. Specifically, it violates Freedom 1 as defined by OSI:</p><p>So, the <em>first sentence</em> of the definition of open-source software has made it abundantly clear that my software isn't open-source because I'm trying to make money off of it. This seems overly restrictive to me, because the source code is still freely available for people to distribute and modify, just not sell. Even then, they can still sell things made with the source code, they just pay a royalty or fee for it.</p><p>Now, there are good reasons why actual <em>free software</em> would forbid this. For example, if someone made an open-source library that required a royalty for commercial use whose code was repeatedly modified over and over again until it crept into all sorts of projects, it could then claim royalties on all of those products, even if only a few lines of its source code were used. This is obviously not conducive to creating a culture of sharing code.</p><p><em>However</em>, there is another benefit of open-source software, which is now becoming progressively more obvious. It's the fact that, if you have the source code and compile it yourself, you can verify the NSA (probably) hasn't injected a backdoor into it. This is a benefit of <em>visibility</em>, and I think it should be encouraged. The problem is that the restrictions placed on free software are too harsh for most commercial libraries, who will then often resort to simply being proprietary.</p><p>So, sadly, there are no open-source commercial licenses, because those aren't <em>open-source</em>. Perhaps we need a new term, for software whose source is <em>accessible</em> but has usage restrictions. Even then, it's not entirely apparent what such a license would look like, or if sites like GitHub would actually allow it on public repositories. I took a peek at the <a href=https://www.unrealengine.com/eula>Unreal Engine 4 license</a>, but despite claiming to have it's source code available on github, it's actually in a <a href=https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine>private repository</a> you must gain access to. To make matters worse, the actual Unreal Engine 4 license is <em>incredibly</em> restrictive. You are only allowed to distribute the engine code to other people who have agreed to the license! This obviously isn't what I want, but apparently no one else seems to think that software that's <em>kind of</em> open-source is actually valuable.</p><p>It's an awful shame, because I really don't want to make my project proprietary, but right now I don't have much choice. As far as I'm concerned, releasing something under a restricted open-source license is preferable to making it entirely proprietary. Unfortunately, the loudest programmers are also the least likely to be willing to compromise over ideological divides.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2015-03-16T03:25:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/is-there-commercial-open-source-license/>March 16, 2015 at 3:25am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/is-there-commercial-open-source-license/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fis-there-commercial-open-source-license%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Is%20There%20A%20Commercial%20Open%20Source%20License%3f&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fis-there-commercial-open-source-license%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fis-there-commercial-open-source-license%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/does-anyone-actually-want-good-software/>Does Anyone Actually Want Good Software?</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Are there any programmers left that actually care about writing good software?

With everyone relentlessly misquoting &ldquo;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&rdquo;, it's hard to get programmers to optimize any of their code <em>at all</em>, let alone get them to care about things like CPU caches and why allocation on the heap is slow and how memory locality matters.</p><p>Some coders exist at large corporations that simply pile on more and more lines of code and force everyone to use gigantic frameworks built on top of more gigantic frameworks built on top of even more gigantic frameworks and then wonder why everything is so slow.

They insist that it's elegant and modern and a bunch of other crap that's all entirely subjective no matter how hard they try to pretend otherwise. Design is about opinions. If I don't like your design, you can't just go and say my opinion is wrong. My opinion isn't wrong, I just don't agree with you. There's a difference.</p><p>However, it has become increasingly apparent to me that opinions aren't allowed in programming. I'm not allowed to say that garbage collectors are bad for high performance software. I'm not allowed to say that pure functional programming isn't some kind of magical holy grail that will solve all your problems. I'm not allowed to say that flat design is stupid. I'm definitely not allowed to say that I hate Python, because apparently Python is a religion.</p><p>Because of this, I am beginning to wonder if I am simply delusional. Apparently I'm the only human being left on planet earth who really, really doesn't like typing magical bullshit into his linux terminal just to get basic things working instead of having a GUI that wasn't designed by brain-dead monkeys. Apparently, I'm the only one who is entirely willing to pay money for services instead of having awful, ad-infested online versions powered by JavaScript™ and Node.js™ that fall over every week because someone forgot to cycle the drives in a cloud service 5000 miles away. Apparently, no one can fix the <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-not-to-sell-software/>audio sample library industry</a> or the fact that most of my VSTi's manage to use 20% of my CPU <em>when they aren't actually doing anything</em>.</p><p>Am I simply getting old? Has the software industry left me behind? Does anyone else out there care about these things? Should I throw in the towel and call it quits? Is the future of software development writing terrible monstrosities held together by duct tape? Is this the only way to have a sustainable business?</p><p>Is this the world our customers want? Because it sure isn't what I want.</p><p>Unfortunately, writing music doesn't pay very well.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2015-02-18T23:10:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/does-anyone-actually-want-good-software/>February 18, 2015 at 11:10pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/does-anyone-actually-want-good-software/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;11 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdoes-anyone-actually-want-good-software%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Does%20Anyone%20Actually%20Want%20Good%20Software%3f&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdoes-anyone-actually-want-good-software%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fdoes-anyone-actually-want-good-software%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/why-dont-you-just-fire-them/>Why Don't You Just Fire Them?</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>Programmers <em>love</em> to bash things like templates and multiple-inheritance and operator overloading, saying that they are abused too often and must be unilaterally banned, going so far as to design them out of their programming languages thinking this is somehow going to save them.</p><p>This makes about as much sense as saying that bank robbers use cars to escape police too much, so we need to ban cars.</p><p>Templates, fundamentally, are very useful and perfectly reasonable things to use in most sane contexts. They are used for things like vectors, where you want an int vector and a float vector. However, people point to the horrible monstrosities like Boost and say &ldquo;Look at all the havoc templates have wrought!&rdquo; Well, yeah. That's what happens when you abuse something. You can abuse anything, trust me. You simply cannot write a programming language that's idiot proof, because if you make <em>anything</em> idiot proof, someone will just make a better idiot.</p><p>Multiple inheritance is usually useful for exactly one thing: taking two distinct object inheritance lines and combining them. If you ever inherit more than two things at once, you probably did something wrong. The problems arise when you start inheriting 8 things and create gigantic inheritance trees with diamonds all over the place. Of course, you can build something just as confusing and unmaintable with single-inheritance (just look at the .net framework), but the point is that the language doesn't have a problem for letting you do this, <em>you</em> have an architectural issue because you're being an idiot.</p><p>You <em>do</em> have code reviews, right? You do realize you can just tell programmers to not do this, or simply not use a library clearly written by <a href=http://www.boost.org/>complete maniacs</a>? Chances are you probably shouldn't have more than one or two template arguments or inherited classes, and you really shouldn't overload the + operator to subtract things. If you do, someone should tell you you're being an idiot in a code review, and if you keep doing it, they should just <em><strong>fire you</strong></em>.</p><p>What really bothers me about these constant attacks on various language features or methodologies is that nearly all of them are <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope>Slippery Slope fallacies</a>. If we let programmers do this, they'll just make something more and more complicated until nobody can use it anymore! It's the same exact argument used for <em>banning gay marriage!</em> If your response to a programmer abusing a feature is to remove the feature, I really have to ask, <strong>why don't you just fire them?</strong> The programmer is the problem here. If anyone succeeds in checking awful code into your code base, you either have a systemic failure in your process, or you've hired an idiot that needs to be fired.</p><p>Programming languages are toolboxes. I want my array of tools to be powerful and adaptable, not artificially castrated because other programmers can't resist the temptation to build leaning towers of inheritance. It's like forcing all your carpenters to use hammers without claws, or banning swiss army knives because someone was using it wrong. If someone is using a tool wrong, it's because they haven't been trained properly, or they're incompetent. The mindset of banning problematic features in programming languages arises from coders who have to maintain bad code, and who are deluding themselves into thinking that if they got rid of those pesky templates, their lives would be much easier.</p><p>Having personally seen a visual basic program that succeeded in being almost impossible to decipher even after several weeks, I can assure you this is not the case, and never will be. The problem is that it's bad code, not that it's written in C++.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2015-02-11T01:32:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-dont-you-just-fire-them/>February 11, 2015 at 1:32am</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/why-dont-you-just-fire-them/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;1 comment</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-dont-you-just-fire-them%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why%20Don%27t%20You%20Just%20Fire%20Them%3f&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-dont-you-just-fire-them%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fwhy-dont-you-just-fire-them%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><article><h4><a href=/blog/how-not-to-sell-software/>How Not To Install Software</a></h4><hr><div class=padding><p>It's that time of the year again, when everyone and their pony puts on a sale, except now it seems to have started much earlier than the traditional Black Friday. Needless to say, this is the only time of year I go around buying expensive sample libraries. One of these libraries was recommended by a friend: LA Scoring Strings - First Chair 2, a cheaper version of LA Scoring Strings. It's $100 off, which is pretty nice, except that the page that describes the product <a href=http://audiobro.com/la-scoring-strings/la-scoring-strings-first-chair/>doesn't actually have a link to buy it</a>. You have to click the STORE link, and then buy it from <em>there</em>, because this is a completely obvious and intuitive interface design (it isn't).</p><p>So, after finding the proper link in the Store and verifying I am actually purchasing what I want to purchase, they give me exactly one payment option: Paypal. This is pretty common, so we'll let it slide, and the whole process seems to go smoothly until they give me my receipt. On the receipt page, they gave me a link to download the files, and a serial number. How helpful! Until I click the download link, which does not open in a new window, and instead opens a completely different webpage with absolutely no way to get back to the page I was just on, because there is no store page with this information and I have no user account on this site. So, I have to go to my e-mail, where they have helpfully e-mailed me a copy of the receipt (probably for this exact reason) to get the serial number.</p><p>I then go back to the download page only to discover that I am <em>required</em> to use their stupid download manager in order to download the product I just bought. There is no alternative option whatsoever. So I download their stupid download manager and it magically installs itself somewhere on my computer I will likely never be able to find because it never asked my permission to do anything, and then demands that I log in. Well, obviously, I don't have a log in, and no one asked me to register until now, so I go to register, which helpfully opens my web browser to register&mldr; on a forum. Well, ok, so I register on the forum with a randomly generated password, and activate my account.</p><p>So naturally, they then <strong>e-mail my password back to me</strong>, which by definition means they are storing it in plaintext. So now the password to my account was sent over an unencrypted, entirely open channel, which is insanely stupid, but this is just a sample library, so whatever. I go back to their download manager and put in my credentials and&mldr; the login fails. Well, maybe it takes a bit to propagate - no, it just isn't working. I try again, and triple check that I have the password right. I log out and back into the forum with that very same password, and it still works. It just doesn't work in the application.</p><p>Standard procedure at this point is for me to take every single weird punctuation character out of my password (making it much weaker) to address the possibility that these people are pants on head retarded and can't handle a password with punctuation in it. I change my password to an alphanumeric one, and lo and behold, I can suddenly log in to the download manager! Let's think about this for a moment. The password I used had some punctuation characters in it (like &ldquo;!&#*@(?&rdquo; etc.), but in order to make sure it was still a valid password, I logged in to the forum with that password, and it succeeded. I then went to this application and put in the <em>same password</em> and it failed to log me in, which means the program actually only accepts some random subset of all valid passwords that the forum lets you register with.</p><p>This is laughably bad programming, but my woes aren't over yet. I click the download button only to get this incredibly helpful message: &ldquo;Cannot connect to download servers.&rdquo; Pissed off, I go play a game in the hopes that once I get back, the servers will work again. I close the game only to discover that my download manager is one giant grey screen no matter what i do to it. It's forgotten how to draw it's own UI at this point. I restart the program, and it has (of course) helpfully forgotten my login credentials. This time, it displays a EULA it apparently forgot to show me the first time around, and once I accept, clicking install successfully starts downloading the files!</p><p>Of course, once the files are installed, they aren't actually <em>installed</em> installed. I have to go into Kontakt and add the libraries to it's magical library in order for them to actually get recognized. I can't tell if this is AudioBro's fault or Native Instruments fault, but at this point I don't care, because this has already become the worst installation experience of any piece of software I have had to go through <em>in my entire life</em>.</p><p>What's frightening is that this is par for the course across the desolate wasteland that is Audio Sample Libraries. The entire audio engineering industry employs draconian and ultimately ineffective DRM security measures, often bundled with installers that look like they were written in 1998 and never updated. The entire industry uses software that is grotesquely bloated, digging it's filthy claws into my operating system and doing all sorts of unspeakable things, and there is <strong>no way out</strong>.</p><p>You can't disrupt this field, because samples rule everything. If you have good samples, people will buy your shitty sample libraries. EastWest moved from Kontakt (which is a pretty shitty piece of software considering it's the best sampler in the entire industry) to their own proprietary PLAY engine, which is unstable, bloated, entirely dependent on ASIO4ALL to even <em>work</em>, and prone to crashing. They still make tons of money, because <em>they have the best orchestral samples</em>, which means people will put up with their incredibly bad sampler just so they can use their samples, which are all in a proprietary format that will get you violently sued if you attempt to reverse engineer it.</p><p>So, even if you develop the best sampler in the world, it won't matter, because without samples, your software is dead on arrival. Almost all the samples that are worth having come in proprietary formats that your program can't understand, and no one can convert these samples to another format (unless they want to reverse engineer the program and get sued, that is). So now the entire sampling industry is locked in a oligopoly of competing samplers that refuse to talk to each other, thus crushing competition by making the cost of entrance so prohibitively high no one can possibly compete with them. And then you get this shit.</p></div><hr><time itemprop=datePublished pubdate=pubdate datetime=2014-11-26T18:53:00+00:00><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Published on <a href=https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-not-to-sell-software/>November 26, 2014 at 6:53pm</a></time><aside><a href=/blog/how-not-to-sell-software/#comments><i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;0 comments</a></aside><aside><i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;share:<ul><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-not-to-sell-software%2f','popup','width=600,height=400');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" d="M16.75 9H13.5V7a1 1 0 011-1h2V3H14a4 4 0 00-4 4V9H8v3h2v9h3.5V12H16z"/></svg></a><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20Not%20To%20Install%20Software&url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-not-to-sell-software%2f','popup','width=600,height=256');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><path class="st0" opacity="0" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path class="st0" d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572.0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66.0.364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342.0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3.0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376.0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57.0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254.0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3a%2f%2ferikmcclure.com%2fblog%2fhow-not-to-sell-software%2f','popup','width=700,height=380');"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="twtr-icon twtr-color-fill--blue-dark has-hover"><style>.st0{fill:#666}</style><rect class="st0" height="11" width="4" x="3" y="9"/><circle class="st0" cx="5" cy="5" r="2"/><path class="st0" d="M16.5 8.25A4.47251 4.47251.0 0013 9.95343V9H9V20h4V13a2 2 0 014 0v7h4V12.75a4.5 4.5.0 00-4.5-4.5z"/></svg></a></li></ul></aside></article><div class=pager><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/8>Newer</a></li><li style=text-align:center><a href=/blog/>Home</a></li><li style=text-align:right><a href=/blog/page/10>Older</a></li></ul></div></section><section class=archive><article><img src=https://erikmcclure.com/img/avatar.th.png alt=Avatar width=180 height=180><h2>Archive</h2><ol><li><details><summary>2023</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/age-of-bullshit/>Welcome to the Age of Bullshit</a></li><li><a href=/blog/nuerodivergents-will-inherit-the-earth/>Neurodivergents Will Inherit The Earth</a></li></ul></details></li><li><details><summary>2022</summary><ul><li><a href=/blog/money-is-fake/>Money Is Fake.
