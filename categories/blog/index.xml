Generalist AIs are still mostly useless, but narrow AIs continue to produce very impressive results. We have plenty of AIs that are better than any human at specific tasks like spotting cancer, but no AIs that can exercise common sense. We can synthesize terrifyingly realistic recreations of almost anyone&amp;rsquo;s voice, but they must be handheld by humans to produce consistent emotional inflection. We have self-driving cars that work fine at noon on a clear day with no construction, but an errant traffic cone makes them panic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Leftists Are In A Purity Death Spiral</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/purity-spiral/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 05:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/purity-spiral/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It seems almost impossible to describe this very simple concept to an increasingly large percentage of leftists: If you disagree with someone&amp;rsquo;s opinion on &lt;code&gt;[Political Position A]&lt;/code&gt;, but agree with them on &lt;code&gt;[Political Position B]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;you can still work with them&lt;/em&gt; to make &lt;code&gt;[Political Position B]&lt;/code&gt; happen, without compromising your stance on &lt;code&gt;[Political Position A]&lt;/code&gt;. This is called forming a &lt;em&gt;political coalition&lt;/em&gt;, a temporary alliance to achieve a common goal. Importantly, you must understand that a political party &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;will never be&lt;/em&gt; a cohesive collection of people who all agree with each other. It is &lt;em&gt;literally impossible&lt;/em&gt; because a political party is so huge and diverse.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The New Discord Overlay Breaks GSync and Borderless Optimizations</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-overlay-breaks-gsync/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 17:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-overlay-breaks-gsync/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The new discord overlay no longer uses DLL injection, and is instead a permanent &lt;code&gt;HWND_TOPMOST&lt;/code&gt; window glued to whatever window it happens to think is a game. Ignoring the fact that discord seems to think FL Studio, the minecraft launcher, and SteamVR&amp;rsquo;s desktop widget are &amp;ldquo;video games&amp;rdquo;, the real problem is that &lt;strong&gt;this breaks the Borderless Windowed Optimizations&lt;/strong&gt;, which has the most obvious effect of disabling GSync/FreeSync on all games that the overlay enables itself on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Do You Really Think We'll Have Genders In The Future?</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/do-you-really-think-we-have-gender-in-the-future/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/do-you-really-think-we-have-gender-in-the-future/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Something that is very common is for people pushing the boundaries of technology (or pretending to, anyway) to hold weirdly conservative social views. This is why &amp;ldquo;techbro&amp;rdquo; is now a thing, and it&amp;rsquo;s not really surprising - there are plenty of engineers that are only good at engineering, not participating in a society, or even understanding how human social interactions work.

I am now knee-deep in several very complex Rust projects that keep slamming into the limitations of the Rust compiler. One of the most common and obnoxious problems is hitting a situation the borrow-checker can&amp;rsquo;t deal with and realizing that I need to completely re-architect how my program works, because lifetimes are &amp;ldquo;contagious&amp;rdquo; the same way async is. Naturally, Rust has both!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rust Async Makes Me Want To Gouge My Eyes Out</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/rust-async-makes-me-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/rust-async-makes-me-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental problems with Rust is the design of &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt;. It is a lightweight, standardized error return value, similar to C-style error codes but implemented at a type system level that can contain arbitrary information. They are easy to use and very useful, and the ecosystem encourages you to use them over &lt;code&gt;panic!&lt;/code&gt; whenever possible. Unfortunately, this ends up creating a problem. &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; is not like a C++ exception because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain a stacktrace by default, nor does the compiler have any idea where it was first constructed, unless the error type it contains decides to include that information upon construction by using &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/backtrace/index.html"&gt;backtrace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Engineers Only Get Paid If Something Is Broken</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*shaking voice*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;so, here&amp;#39;s the thing — you&amp;#39;re not gonna force all of us to learn rust&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the way this is said... you&amp;#39;d think they were being deported or something. incredibly childish people at the helm there.&lt;a href="https://t.co/fcgA6m9fvq"&gt;https://t.co/fcgA6m9fvq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; fasterthanlime (@fasterthanlime) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1829574164854030843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 30, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Rust people have been getting frustrated with C developers who seem to base their entire personal identity on being able to do unsafe memory things. The thing is, this is not a phenomenon unique to C developers, or even software developers in general, although the visibility of the kernel C developers is higher than the average programmer. Most people will be upset about technology that makes their particular skillset irrelevent. This is best summarized by a famous quote:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Measuring Competence Is Epistemic Hell</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/measuring-competence-is-epistemic-hell/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law"&gt;Sturgeon&amp;rsquo;s law&lt;/a&gt; states that 90% of everything is crap. Combined with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor"&gt;Hanlon&amp;rsquo;s Razor&lt;/a&gt;, we arrive at the inescapable conclusion that most problems are caused by incompetence. What&amp;rsquo;s particularly interesting is that the number of incompetent people in a system tends to increase the higher up you go. Part of this is due to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle"&gt;Peter Principle&lt;/a&gt;, where organizations promote employees until they become incompetent, but this happens in the first place because it becomes &lt;em&gt;harder to measure competence&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; the longer it takes the effects of actions to be felt, and as a species we have no way of measuring long-term incompetence. Instead, we rely on social cues, and tend to use whatever our local culture determines is &amp;ldquo;competent&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;[programmers frantically pulling cables out of the wall]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AI: &amp;quot;Nuclear power.

&lt;p&gt;I remember growing up with that same old adage of how you could be the next scientist to invent a cure for cancer, or a solution to climate change, or whatever. What they don&amp;rsquo;t tell you is that we already have solutions for a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of problems, we just don&amp;rsquo;t use them. Sometimes this is because the solution is too expensive, but usually it&amp;rsquo;s because competing interests create a tragedy of the commons. Most problems in the modern age aren&amp;rsquo;t complicated engineering problems, they&amp;rsquo;re the same problem: coordination failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>People Can't Care About Everything</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 20:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/</guid><description>&lt;div class="imgwrap" style="max-width:1172px"&gt;&lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/img/linux-tweet.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://erikmcclure.com/img/linux-tweet.png" alt="Sorry, I need my computer to work" width="100%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally posted an even more snarky response to this, but later deleted it when I realized they were just a teenager. Kids do not have decades of experience with buggy drivers, infuriating edge-cases, and broken promises necessary to understand and contribute to the underlying debate here (nor do they have the social context to know that Xe and I were just joking with each other). Of course, they also don&amp;rsquo;t know that it&amp;rsquo;s generally considered poor taste to interject like this, as it tends to annoy everyone and &lt;em&gt;almost always&lt;/em&gt; fails to take into consideration the greater context in which someone might be using Windows, or Mac, or TikTok, or Twitter, or whatever corporate hellscape they are trapped in. The thing is, &lt;em&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s always a reason&lt;/em&gt;. You might not &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the reason, but there is usually a reason someone has locked themselves inside the Apple ecosystem, or subjected themselves to Twitter, or tried to eke a living from beneath the lovecraftian whims of YouTube&amp;rsquo;s recommendation algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 13:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames"&gt;Discord&amp;rsquo;s Recent Announcement&lt;/a&gt; made a lot of people mad, mostly because of &lt;a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/"&gt;Hyrum&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt; - users were relying on unintended observable behavior in the original username system, and are mad that their use-cases are being broken despite very good evidence that the current system is problematic. I think the major issue here is that Discord didn&amp;rsquo;t go far enough, and as a result, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing users who are unaware of the technical and practical reasons for the username change, or what a username is even for.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Money Is Fake.

&lt;p&gt;I want to start this by saying that I am in favor of a wealth tax. We should be increasing taxes on the wealthy and raising minimum wage, because we know that steadily increasing the relative buying power of the poor is the best way to improve an economy. However, none of this happens in a vacuum. When we talk about income equality, I have become distressed at the amount of ignorance on display about the economy, systemic societal problems, and even what money actually is.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>We Need New Motherboards Before GPUs Collapse Under Their Own Gravity</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-need-new-motherboards/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-need-new-motherboards/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t have a 4-slot GPU. You just can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have finally left sanity behind, with nvidia&amp;rsquo;s 4000 series cards yielding a &amp;ldquo;clown car&amp;rdquo; of absurd GPU designs, as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGARjRBJRX8"&gt;GamersNexus put it&lt;/a&gt;. These cards are so huge they need &amp;ldquo;GPU Support Sticks&amp;rdquo;, which are an &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072925/custom-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-4080s-graphics-cards-insane.html"&gt;actual real thing now&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that we insist on relegating the GPU to interfacing with the system while hanging off of a single, increasingly absurd PCIe 6.0 x16 slot that can &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17203/pcie-60-specification-finalized-x16-slots-to-reach-128gbps"&gt;push 128 GBps&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;completely insane&lt;/strong&gt;. There is no real ability to just pick the GPU you want and then pair it with a cooler that is &lt;em&gt;actually attached to the motherboard&lt;/em&gt;. The entire cooling solution has to be in the card itself and we are fast reaching the practical limitations here due to gravity and the laws of physics. Top-heavy GPUs are now essentially giant levers pulling on the PCIe slot, with the only possible anchor point that is above the center of mass being the bracket on one side.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>C++ Constructors, Memory, and Lifetimes</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/cpp-constructors-memory-and-lifetimes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 23:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/cpp-constructors-memory-and-lifetimes/</guid><description>&lt;div class="imgwrap" style="max-width:400px"&gt;&lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/img/cpp_init_forest.gif" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://erikmcclure.com/img/cpp_init_forest.gif" alt="C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; Initialization Hell" width="100%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly happens when you write &lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;Foo* foo = new Foo();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;? A lot is packed into this one statement, so lets try to break it down. First, this example is allocating new memory on the heap, but in order to understand everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on, we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to explain what it means to declare a variable &lt;em&gt;on the stack&lt;/em&gt;.

It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that if you allocate something using aligned new, you &lt;strong&gt;absolutely must&lt;/strong&gt; deallocate it &lt;a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/delete"&gt;using aligned delete&lt;/a&gt;, or the behavior is undefined. LLVM 10.x takes advantage of this alignment parameter, if the compiler supports it.

My friends and I were determined to keep our discord server public, so I went about creating the first anti-spam bot for Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no longer maintaining this bot beyond simple bugfixes because I have better things to do with my time, and I&amp;rsquo;m tired of people trying to use it because &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s the best anti-spam bot&amp;rdquo; even after I deprecated it. This post is an effort to educate all the other anti-spam bots on how to ascend beyond a simple &amp;ldquo;mute someone if they send more than N messages in M seconds&amp;rdquo; filter and hopefully make better anti-spam bots so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Name Shadowing Should Be An Operator</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/name-shadowing-should-be-an-operator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2019 13:23:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/name-shadowing-should-be-an-operator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered that in Rust, this is a relatively common operation:
&lt;pre class="language-rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let foo = String::from(&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;);
// stuff that needs ownership
let foo = &amp;amp;foo; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Or this:
&lt;pre class="language-rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let mut vec = Vec::new();
vec.push(&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;);
vec.push(&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;);
let vec = vec; /* vec is immutable now */ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This is a particularly permissive form of &lt;strong&gt;name-shadowing&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows you to re-declare a variable in an inner scope that &lt;em&gt;shadows&lt;/em&gt; the name of a variable in an outer scope, making the outer variable inaccessible. Almost every single programming language in common use allows you to do this in some form or another. Rust goes a step further and lets you re-declare a variable &lt;em&gt;inside the same scope&lt;/em&gt; as another variable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Rant On Terra</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/a-rant-on-terra/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 17:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/a-rant-on-terra/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Metaprogramming, or the ability to inspect, modify and generate code at compile-time (as opposed to reflection, which is runtime introspection of code), has slowly been gaining momentum.

As an applied mathematician whose coding involves plenty of multiplication, I was not happy to hear this. Nobody who does math actually memorizes times tables, and furthermore, forcing a child to memorize &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is probably the worst possible thing you can do in modern society. No one should &lt;em&gt;memorize&lt;/em&gt; their times tables, they should learn how to &lt;em&gt;calculate them&lt;/em&gt;. Forcing children to memorize useless equations for no reason is a great way to either ensure they hate math, teach them they should blindly memorize and believe anything adults tell them, or both. So for any parents who wish to teach their children how to be critical thinkers and give them an advantage on their next math test, I am going to describe how to derive the entire times tables with only 12 rules.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ignoring Outliers Creates Racist Algorithms</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ignoring-outliers-creates-racist/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/ignoring-outliers-creates-racist/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Have you built an algorithm that &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; works?

Congratulations, your algorithm is racist! To illustrate how this happens, let&amp;rsquo;s take a recent example from Facebook. My friend&amp;rsquo;s message was removed for &amp;ldquo;violating community standards&amp;rdquo;.

Then Larry Page became CEO and &lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/"&gt;I realized they were not a magical unicorn&lt;/a&gt; and lamented the fact that they had been transformed into &amp;ldquo;just another large company&amp;rdquo;. Several important things happened between that post and now: Microsoft got a new CEO, so I decided to give them a shot and got hired there. I quit right before Windows 10 came out because I knew it was going to be a disaster. More recently, it&amp;rsquo;s become apparent that Google had gone far past simply being a behemoth unconcerned with the cries of the helpless and transformed into something outright malevolent.

However, the FFI library only accepts a subset of the C standard. Specifically, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;C declarations are not passed through a C pre-processor, yet. No pre-processor tokens are allowed, except for #pragma pack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; The website suggests running the header file through a preprocesser stage, but I have yet to find a LuaJIT tutorial that actually explains how to do this. Instead, all the examples simply copy+paste the function prototype into the Lua file itself. Doing this with makefiles and GCC is trivial, because you just have to add a compile step using &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.1/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html"&gt;the &lt;code&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/a&gt;, but integrating this with Visual Studio is more difficult. In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to properly load scripts and modify the PATH lookup variable so your game can have a proper &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; folder instead of dumping everything in &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Discord: Rise Of The Bot Wars</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-rise-of-bot-wars/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2017 08:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-rise-of-bot-wars/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The most surreal experience I ever had on discord was when someone PMed me to complain that my anti-spam bot wasn&amp;rsquo;t working against a 200+ bot raid. I pointed out that it was never designed for large-scale attacks, and that discord&amp;rsquo;s own rate-limiting would likely make it useless. He revealed he was selling spambot accounts at a rate of about $1 for 100 unique accounts and that he was being attacked by a rival spammer. My anti-spam bot had been dragged into a turf war between two spambot networks. We discussed possible mitigation strategies for worst-case scenarios, but agreed that most of them would involve false-positives and that discord showed no interest in fixing how exploitable their API was. I hoped that I would never have to implement such extreme measures into my bot.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Companies Can't Be Apolitical</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/companies-cant-be-apolitical/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 00:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/companies-cant-be-apolitical/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common things I hear from people is that companies should be &amp;ldquo;apolitical&amp;rdquo;. The most formal way this concept is expressed is that a company should make decisions based on what maximizes profits and not political opinions. Unfortunately, the statement &amp;ldquo;companies should only care about maximizing profits&amp;rdquo; is, itself, a political statement (and one I happen to disagree with). Thus, it is fundamentally impossible for a company to be &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; apolitical, for the very act of attempting to be apolitical is a political statement.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Windows Won't Let My Program Crash</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/windows-wont-let-my-program-crash/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/windows-wont-let-my-program-crash/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been known for a while that windows has a bad habit of &lt;a href="http://blog.paulbetts.org/index.php/2010/07/20/the-case-of-the-disappearing-onload-exception-user-mode-callback-exceptions-in-x64/"&gt;eating your exceptions&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re inside a WinProc callback function. This behavior can cause all sorts of mayhem, like your program just vanishing into thin air without any error messages due to a stack overflow that terminated the program without actually throwing an exception. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize is that it also eats &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt;, which makes debugging hell, because the assertion would throw, the entire user callback would immediately terminate without any stack unwinding, and then windows would just&amp;hellip; keep going, even though the program is now in a laughably corrupt state, because only half the function executed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DirectX Is Terrifying</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/directx-is-terrifying/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/directx-is-terrifying/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;About two months ago, I got a new laptop and proceeded to load all my projects on it. Despite compiling everything fine, my graphics engine that used DirectX mysteriously crashed upon running. I immediately suspected either a configuration issue or a driver issue, but this seemed weird because my laptop had a &lt;em&gt;newer&lt;/em&gt; graphics card than my desktop. Why was it crashing on &lt;em&gt;newer&lt;/em&gt; hardware? Things got even more bizarre once I narrowed down the issue - it was in my shader assignment code, which hadn&amp;rsquo;t been touched in almost 2 years. While I initially suspected a shader compilation issue, there was no such error in the logs. All the shaders compiled fine, and then&amp;hellip; didn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Everyone Does sRGB Wrong Because Everyone Else Does sRGB Wrong</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/everyone-does-srgb-wrong-because/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2016 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/everyone-does-srgb-wrong-because/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that CSS3 does all its linear gradients and color interpolation completely wrong? All color values in CSS3 are in the sRGB color space, because that&amp;rsquo;s the color space that gets displayed on our monitor. However, the problem is that the sRGB color space looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/SRGB_gamma.svg/250px-SRGB_gamma.svg.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/SRGB_gamma.svg/250px-SRGB_gamma.svg.png" alt="sRGB gamma curve" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to do a linear interpolation along a nonlinear curve doesn&amp;rsquo;t work very well. Instead, you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to linearize your color values, transforming the sRGB curve to the linear RGB curve before doing your operation, and then transforming it back into the sRGB curve. This is gamma correction. Here are comparisons between gradients, transitions, alpha blending, and image resizing done directly in sRGB space (assuming your browser complies with the W3C spec) versus in linear RGB:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mathematical Notation Is Awful</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/mathematical-notation-is-awful/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2016 22:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/mathematical-notation-is-awful/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, a friend asked me for help figuring out how to calculate the standard deviation over a discrete probability distribution. I pulled up &lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/blog/course-notes/"&gt;my notes from college&lt;/a&gt; and was able to correctly calculate the standard deviation they had been unable to derive after hours upon hours of searching the internet and trying to piece together poor explanations from questionable sources. The crux of the problem was, as I had suspected, the astonishingly bad notation involved with this particular calculation. You see, the expected value of a given distribution &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ X $$&lt;/span&gt; is expressed as &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ E[X] $$&lt;/span&gt;, which is calculated using the following formula:
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\[ E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} x_i p(x_i) \]&lt;/div&gt;
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and the variance is given in terms of the expected value.
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\[ Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \]&lt;/div&gt;
Except that &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ E[X^2] $$&lt;/span&gt; is of course completely different from &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ (E[X])^2 $$&lt;/span&gt;, but it gets worse, because &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ E[X^2] $$&lt;/span&gt; makes &lt;em&gt;no notational sense whatsoever&lt;/em&gt;. In any other function, in math, doing &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ f(x^2) $$&lt;/span&gt; means going through and substitution &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ x $$&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ x^2 $$&lt;/span&gt;. In this case, however, &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ E[X] $$&lt;/span&gt; actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with the resulting equation, because &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ X \neq x_i $$&lt;/span&gt;, and as a result, the equation for &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ E[X^2] $$&lt;/span&gt; is this:
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\[ E[X^2] = \sum_i x_i^2 p(x_i) \]&lt;/div&gt;
Only the first &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ x_i $$&lt;/span&gt; is squared. &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ p(x_i) $$&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense in the first place. It should really be just &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ P_{Xi} $$&lt;/span&gt; or something, because it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;discrete value&lt;/em&gt;, not a function! It would also explain why the &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ x_i $$&lt;/span&gt; inside &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ p() $$&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t squared - because it &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t even exist&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s just a gross abuse of notation. This situation is so bloody confusing I even explicitely laid out the equation for &lt;span class="math"&gt;$$ E[X^2] $$&lt;/span&gt; in my own notes, presumably to prevent me from trying to figure out what the hell was going on in the middle of my final.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Tried To Install Linux And Now I Regret Everything</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-tried-to-install-linux-and-now-i/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 00:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/i-tried-to-install-linux-and-now-i/</guid><description>&lt;style&gt;.imghover img { display:none; position:absolute; margin-top:-350px; right:0; background: white; border: 1px solid black; } .imghover:hover img, .imghover:focus img { float:left; display:block; }&lt;/style&gt;I am going to tell you a story.
&lt;p&gt;This story began with me getting pissed off at Windows for reasons that don&amp;rsquo;t really need to be articulated. Just, pick your favorite reason to hate Windows, and let&amp;rsquo;s pretend that was the tipping point. I had some spare space on my secondary drive, so I decided to give Linux another whirl.

Instead, I am designing software for a bunch of highly emotional, irrational creatures called *human beings*, all of whom have enormously different tastes. I try to include options, or customization, or if that isn't possible, a compromise. I try to keep the door open, to let my software be used as a tool to enhance someone's productivity no matter what workflow they use, instead of trying to impose my own workflow on them.
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, many programmers seem to struggle with the concept of people being different. They get hung up on this naïve concept of &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, as if life is some kind of mathematical equation that has a closed form solution. Let me say right now that any solution to life is going to be one heck of a chaotic nonlinear PDE, which won&amp;rsquo;t have any closed form solution at all, and certainly not one using elementary functions. When you are developing software, you must keep in mind the &lt;em&gt;range&lt;/em&gt; of customers who will be using your product, whether they are office workers or fellow programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using Data To Balance Your Game: Pony Clicker Analysis</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/using-data-to-balance-your-game-pony/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2015 10:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/using-data-to-balance-your-game-pony/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;*The only thing more addicting than heroine are numbers that keep getting larger.*&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since when did &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; get to choose what makes them happy? Can you &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to like strawberries? Can you &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to enjoy the smell of dandelions? At best, you can subject yourself to something over and over and over again and enjoy it as a sort of acquired taste, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work, and the fact remains that you are still predisposed to enjoying certain experiences. Unless we make a concentrated effort to change our preferences, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; enjoyable sensory experiences occur &lt;em&gt;without our consent&lt;/em&gt;. We are not in charge of what combination of neural impulses our brain happens to find enjoyable.

If you define &lt;em&gt;photorealistic&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;any still frame is indistinguishable from a real photo&lt;/em&gt;, then we can get pretty close. Unfortunately, the problem with video games is that they are not still frames - they &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What people don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that modern games rely on faking a lot of stuff, and that means they only &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; photorealistic in a very tight set of circumstances. They rely on you not paying close attention to environmental details so you don&amp;rsquo;t notice that the grass is actually just painted on to the terrain. They precompute environmental convolution maps and bake ambient occlusion and radiance information into level architecture. You can&amp;rsquo;t knock down a building in a game unless it is specifically programmed to be breakable and all the necessary preparations are made. Changes in levels are often scripted, with complex physical changes and graphical consequences being largely precomputed and simply triggered at the appropriate time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google's Decline Really Bugs Me</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 11:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/googles-decline-really-bugs-me/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Google is going down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="padding-left:1em;"&gt;1. an extremely confused, complicated, or embarrassing situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Across the country, there is a heated debate over our educational system. Unfortunately, it's a lot like watching members of the flat earth society argue about whose theory is right - there is no right answer, because *everyone is wrong*.
&lt;p&gt;The most recent and perhaps egregious example of this is a breathtakingly misguided &lt;a href="http://blogs.seattletimes.com/educationlab/2013/10/27/roundtable-can-tracking-ever-work/#2"&gt;article by Kevin G. Welner&lt;/a&gt;, who is the director of the National Education Policy center, which is absolutely terrifying. He is attempting to discredit the idea of &amp;ldquo;tracking&amp;rdquo;, wherein low-performing students are separated from higher achieving students, because obviously you can&amp;rsquo;t teach kids who &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo; the same way as kids who are struggling. Unfortunately, the entire conclusion rests on a logical fallacy.

&lt;p&gt;The burgeoning complexity of software is perhaps one of the most persistent problems plaguing computer science. We have tried many, many ways of managing this complexity: inventing new languages, creating management systems, and enforcing coding styles. They have all proven to be nothing more than stopgaps. With the revelation that the NSA is utilizing the inherent complexity of software systems to sabotage our efforts at securing our systems, this problem has become even more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Most People Have Shitty Computers</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/most-people-have-shitty-computers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2013 21:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/most-people-have-shitty-computers/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;*Premature optimization is the root of all evil* - Donald Knuth&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started putting words on the internet, I have complained about the misinterpretation and overgeneralization of this Donald Knuth quote. Developers essentially use it as an excuse to never optimize anything, because they can always say they &amp;ldquo;aren&amp;rsquo;t done yet&amp;rdquo; and then permanently render all optimizations as premature. The fact that &amp;ldquo;premature&amp;rdquo; is inherently a subjective term doesn&amp;rsquo;t help. The quote was meant to target very low-level optimizations that are largely useless until you&amp;rsquo;re positive everything else is working properly and you have no other low-hanging fruit to optimize.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Leap Motion Impressions, Input Sanitation, and 3D Gesture Ideas</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/leap-motion-impressions-input/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2013 17:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/leap-motion-impressions-input/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;**Pros:**

&lt;p&gt;Aurora Theory has been 4 years in the making, a compilation of all the songs I managed to make in the middle of attending university. The earlier songs have been extensively improved, and all songs have been remastered for the album&amp;rsquo;s release. This album represents nothing less than the highest quality work I can possibly manage at this point in my career. I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired a fair number of fans over the years, and I want to thank you for supporting my musical endeavors so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What I Learned In College</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/what-i-learned-in-college/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2013 07:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/what-i-learned-in-college/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;*"In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists."* ― Eric Hoffer&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the University of Washington finally mailed me my diploma. A Bachelor of Science in &lt;em&gt;Applied Computational Math and Science: Discrete Math and Algorithms&lt;/em&gt;. I learned a lot of things in college. I learned how to take tests and how to pinpoint exactly what useless crap a particular final needed me to memorize. I learned that math is an incredibly beautiful thing that has been butchered so badly I hated it all the way until my second year of college. I learned that creativity is useless and all problems have one specific right answer you can find in the back of a textbook somewhere, because that&amp;rsquo;s all I was ever graded on. I learned that getting into the CSE major is more about fighting an enormous, broken bureaucratic mess than actually being good at computer science. But most of all, I learned that our educational system is so obsessed with itself it can&amp;rsquo;t even recognize it&amp;rsquo;s own shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Course Notes</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/course-notes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2013 18:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/course-notes/</guid><description>&lt;div class="math"&gt;
It's standard procedure at the University of Washington to allow a single sheet of handwritten notes during a Mathematics exam. I started collecting these sheets after I realized how useful it was to have a reference that basically summarized all the useful parts of the course on a single sheet of paper. Now that I've graduated, it's easy for me to quickly forget all the things I'm not using. The problem is that, when I need to say, develop an algorithm for simulating turbulent airflow, I need to go back and re-learn vector calculus, differential equations and nonlinear dynamics. So I've decided to digitize all my notes and put them in one place where I can reference them. I've uploaded it here in case they come in handy to anyone else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earlier courses listed here had to be reconstructed from my class notes because I'd thrown my final notesheet away or otherwise lost it. The classes are not listed in the order I took them, but rather organized into related groups. This post may be updated later with expanded explanations for some concepts, but these are highly condensed notes for reference, and a lot of it won't make sense to someone who hasn't taken a related course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 120%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Math 124 - Calculus I&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;lost&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span

$$f_x(0,0)=0$$ and $$f_y(0,0)=0$$ then $$df(0,0;h,l)=0h+0k=0$$ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graph of $$y(x,y)$$ lies on a level surface $$F(x,y,z)=c$$ means $$f(x,y(x,z),z)=c$$. So then use the chain rule to figure out the result in terms of $$F$$ partials by considering $$F$$ a composite function $$F(x,y(x,z),z)$$. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fundamental implicit function theorem: Let $$F(x,y,z)$$ be a function defined on an open set $$S$$ containing the point $$(x_0,y_0,z_0)$$. Suppose $$F$$ has continuous partial derivatives in $$S$$. Furthermore assume that: $$F(x_0,y_0,z_0)=0, F_z(x_0,y_0,z_0)\neq 0$$. Then $$z=f(x,y)$$ exists, is continuous, and has continuous first partial derivatives. &lt;div style="display: inline-block;margin-right: 2em;"&gt;\[ f_x = -\frac{F_x}{F_z} \]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="display: inline-block;margin-right: 2em;"&gt;\[ f_y = -\frac{F_y}{F_z} \]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, if &lt;div style="display: inline-block;"&gt;\[ \begin{vmatrix} F_x &amp; F_y \\ G_x &amp; G_y \end{vmatrix} \neq 0 \]&lt;/div&gt;, then we can solve $$x$$ and $$y$$ as functions of $$z$$. Since the cross-product is made of these determinants, if the $$x$$ component is nonzero, you can solve $$y,z$$ as functions of $$x$$, and therefore graph it on the $$x-axis$$. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To solve level surface equations, let $$F(x,y,z)=c$$ and $$G(x,y,z)=d$$, then use the chain rule, differentiating by the remaining variable (e.g. $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$ and $$\frac{dz}{dx}$$ means do $$x$$) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="display: inline-block;margin-right: 2em;"&gt;\[ \begin{matrix} F_x + F_y y_x + F_z z_x = 0 \\ G_x + G_y y_x + G_z z_x = 0 \end{matrix} \]&lt;/div&gt;if you solve for $$y_x$$,$$z_x$$, you get &lt;div style="display: inline-block;margin-right: 2em;"&gt;\[ \left[ \begin{matrix} F_y &amp;

A &lt;ins&gt;walk&lt;/ins&gt; is a path through a series of connected edges. A &lt;ins&gt;trail&lt;/ins&gt; is a walk where no edge is traveled on more than once. A &lt;ins&gt;closed trail&lt;/ins&gt; starts and stops on the same vertex. A &lt;ins&gt;Eulerian trail&lt;/ins&gt; uses all edges in a graph. A trail that doesn't touch a vertex more than once is a &lt;ins&gt;path&lt;/ins&gt;. $$K_n$$ is the complete graph on $$n$$-vertices. &lt;br /&gt;If one can reach any vertex from any other on a graph $$G$$, then $$G$$ is a &lt;ins&gt;connected graph&lt;/ins&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;A connected graph has a closed Eulerian trail if and only if all its vertices have even degree. Otherwise, it has a Eulerian trail starting on S and ending on T if only S and T have odd degree. &lt;br /&gt;In a graph without loops there are an even number of vertices of odd-degree. A cycle touches all vertices only once, except for the vertex it starts and ends on. A Hamiltonian cycle touches all vertices on a graph. &lt;br /&gt;Let $$G$$ be a graph on $$n \ge 3$$ vertices, then $$G$$ has a Hamiltonian cycle if all vertices in $$G$$ have degree equal or greater than $$n/2$$. A complete graph $$K_n$$ has $$\binom{n}{k}\frac{(k-1)!}{2}$$ cycles of $$k$$-vertices. &lt;br /&gt;Total Cycles: &lt;div style="display: inline-block;margin-right: 2em;"&gt;\[ \sum_{k=3}^n\binom{n}{k}\frac{(k-1)!}{2} \]&lt;/div&gt;Hamiltonian cycles: &lt;div style="display: inline-block;margin-right: 2em;"&gt;\[ \frac{(n-1)!}{2} \]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two graphs are the same if for any pair of vertices, the number of edges connecting them is the same in both graphs. If this holds when they are unlabeled, they are isomorphic. &lt;br /&gt;A Tree is a minimally connected graph: Removing any edge yields a disconnected graph. Trees have no cycles, so any connected graph with no cycles is a tree. &lt;br /&gt;All trees on $$n$$ vertices have $$n-1$$ edges, so any connected graph with $$n-1$$ edges is a tree. &lt;br /&gt;Let $$T$$ be a tree on $$n \ge 2$$ vertices, then T has at least two vertices of degree 1. &lt;br /&gt;Let $$F$$ be a forest on $$n$$ vertices with $$k$$ trees. Then F has $$n-k$$ edges. &lt;br /&gt;Cayley's formula: The number of all trees with vertex set $$[n]$$ is $$A_n = n^{n-2}$$ &lt;br /&gt;A connected graph $$G$$ can be drawn on a plane so that no two edges intersect, then G is a planar graph. &lt;br /&gt;A connected planar graph or convex polyhedron satisfies: Vertices + Faces = Edges + 2 &lt;br /&gt;$$K_{3,3}$$ and $$K_5$$ are not planar, nor is any graph with a subgraph that is edge-equivalent to them. &lt;br /&gt;A convex Polyhedron with V vertices, E edges, and F faces satisfies: $$3F \le 3E$$, $$3V \le 3E$$, $$E \le 3V-6$$, $$E \le 3F-6$$, one face has at most 5 edges, and one vertex has at most degree 5. &lt;br /&gt;$$K_{3,3}$$ has 6 vertices and 9 edges &lt;br /&gt;A graph on $$n$$-vertices has $$\binom{n}{2}$$ possible edges. &lt;br /&gt;If a graph is planar, then $$E \le 3V - 6$$.

&lt;p&gt;The window is created and assigned a WndProc callback function inside this DLL, as per the various absurd requirements involving how you create windows in Windows.

However, when we fixate on productivity to the exclusion of everything else, we often forget about the big picture.

&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with C#, you should be familiar with the difference between C#&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; declarations. Namely, a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; is a value type and a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; is a reference type, meaning that if you pass a struct to a function, its default behavior is for the entire struct to be &lt;strong&gt;copied&lt;/strong&gt; into the function&amp;rsquo;s parameter, so any modifications made to it won&amp;rsquo;t affect whatever was passed in. On the flip side, a class is a reference value, so a &lt;strong&gt;reference&lt;/strong&gt; is passed into the function, and any changes made to that reference will be reflected in the object that was originally passed into the function.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>7 Problems Raytracing Doesn't Solve</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/7-problems-raytracing-doesnt-solve/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2012 04:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/7-problems-raytracing-doesnt-solve/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of people get excited about extreme concurrency in modern hardware bringing us closer to the magical holy grail of &lt;em&gt;raytracing&lt;/em&gt;.

In the interests of SCIENCE (and possibly accidentally DDoSing Randall&amp;rsquo;s image server - sorry!), I created a static HTML file of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blackspherestudios.com/storage/xkcd_huge_static.html"&gt;entire composite image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collage is made up of 225 images&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that stretch out over a total image area 79872 pixels high and 165888 pixels wide. The images take up 5.52 MB of space and are named with a simple naming scheme &lt;code&gt;&amp;#34;ydxd.png&amp;#34;&lt;/code&gt; where d represents a cardinal direction appropriate for the axis (n for north, s for south on the y axis and e for east, w for west on the x axis) along with the tile coordinate number; for example, &lt;code&gt;&amp;#34;1n1e.png&amp;#34;&lt;/code&gt;. Tiles are 2048x2048 png images with an average size of 24.53 KB. If you were to try and represent this as a single, uncompressed 32-bit 79872x165888 image file, it would take up 52.99 GB of space.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Coordinate Systems And Cascading Stupidity</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/coordinate-systems-and-cascading/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2012 01:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/coordinate-systems-and-cascading/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that there are way too many coordinate systems, and that I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot (but that was already well-established). I have also learned to not trust graphics tutorials, but the reasons for that won&amp;rsquo;t become apparent until the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Orientation_and_handedness"&gt;two types of coordinate systems&lt;/a&gt;: left-handed and right-handed coordinate systems. By convention, most everyone in math and science uses right-handed coordinate systems with positive x going to the right, positive y going up, and positive z coming out of the screen. A left-handed coordinate system is the same, but positive z instead points into the screen. Of course, there are many other possible coordinate system configurations, each either being right or left-handed; some modern CAD packages have y pointing into the screen and z pointing up, and screen-space in graphics traditionally has y pointing down and z pointing into the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Joysticks Ruined My Graphics Engine</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-joysticks-ruined-my-graphics-engine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jun 2012 22:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/how-joysticks-ruined-my-graphics-engine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost a tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time my graphics engine has been stuck in maintenence mode for 6 months, I&amp;rsquo;ll suddenly realize I need to push out an update or implement some new feature. I then realize that I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually paid attention to any of my testing programs, or their speed, in months. This is followed by panic, as I discover my engine running at half speed, or worse. Having made an infinite number of tiny tweaks that all could have caused the problem, I am often thrown into temporary despair only to almost immediately find some incredibly stupid mistake that was causing it. One time it was because I left the profiler on. Another time it was caused by calling the Render function twice.

It demonstrates that mobile gaming is behaving as a disruptive technology, and is causing the same market decline in consoles that consoles themselves did to arcades in the 1990s. He also demonstrates how TV crushed cinema in a similar manner - we just don&amp;rsquo;t think of it like that because we don&amp;rsquo;t remember back when almost &lt;strong&gt;60% of the population&lt;/strong&gt; was going to the movie theaters on a weekly basis. Today, most people tend to go to the movie theater as a special occasion, so the theaters didn&amp;rsquo;t completely die out, they just lost their market dominance.

Unfortunately the beta only lets you change its install location if the preview developer preview isn&amp;rsquo;t installed, and the developer preview had installed itself into C:\ without ever letting me change the path, which was annoying.

This finally got Mint 12 to show up, and I later confirmed that the nvidia drivers were broken. I then discovered that the nvidia drivers in the distribution for apt-get sources are almost &lt;strong&gt;120 versions&lt;/strong&gt; behind the current release (295), but the installer for that kept failing despite my attempts to fix it and having to add source repositories to apt-get because apparently these are disabled by default, which confused me greatly for a short period whilst trying to install the Linux source. This ultimately proved futile since Nvidia can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to make anything remotely easy for Linux, so I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with a half-broken default driver that can&amp;rsquo;t use my second monitor with a mouse cursor that repeatedly blinks out of existence in a very aggravating manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>'Programmer' is an Overgeneralization</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/new-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2012 20:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/new-post/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;*"Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it."* - Donald Knuth&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brushed it off as artistic license and perceptual trickery, but over the years, as I dug into advanced lighting concepts, nothing could explain this. It was a mystery.

&lt;p&gt;Signed integers have always bugged me.

Why would you &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; write that? &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; cannot possibly be negative and for that matter shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be negative, ever.

&lt;p&gt;Classes in C#, like most object-oriented languages, are very similar to their C++ counterparts. They are declared with &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;, exist between brackets and inherit classes using a colon &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;. Note, however, that all classes in C++ &lt;strong&gt;must end with a semicolon!&lt;/strong&gt; You will forget this semicolon, and then &lt;em&gt;all the things will break&lt;/em&gt;. You can do pretty much everything you can do with a C# class in a C++ class, except that C++ does not have &lt;code&gt;partial&lt;/code&gt; classes, and in C++ classes themselves cannot be declared &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;.

Because you don&amp;rsquo;t do any buffering, your user might end up with a quarter circle drawn for a frame. This can be solved through Double Buffering, which means you draw the circle on to a backbuffer, then &amp;ldquo;flip&amp;rdquo; (or copy) the completed image on to the screen. This means you will only ever send a completely drawn scene to the monitor, but you will still have tearing issues. These are caused by trying to update the monitor outside of its refresh rate, meaning you will have only finished drawing half of your new scene over the old scene in the monitor&amp;rsquo;s video buffer when it updates itself, resulting in half the scanlines on the screen having the new scene and half still having the old scene, which gives the impression of tearing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>C# to C++ Tutorial - Part 2: Pointers Everywhere!</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2011 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[ &lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; · &lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-3-classes-and/"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-4-operator-overload/"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="color:#aaa;"&gt;· 5 · 6 · 7&lt;/span&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have a lot of ground to cover on pointers, but before we do, we need to address certain conceptual frameworks missing from C# that one must be intimately familiar with when moving to C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, in C# you mostly work with the &lt;strong&gt;Heap&lt;/strong&gt;. The heap is not difficult to understand - its a giant lump of memory that you take chunks out of to allocate space for your classes. Anything using the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword is allocated on the heap, which ends up being almost everything in a C# program. However, the heap isn&amp;rsquo;t the only source of memory - there is also the &lt;strong&gt;Stack&lt;/strong&gt;. The Stack is best described as what your program lives inside of. I&amp;rsquo;ve said before that everything takes up memory, and yes, that includes your program. The thing is that the Heap is inherently dynamic, while the Stack is inherently &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt;. Both can be re-purposed to do the opposite, but trying to get the Stack to do dynamic allocation is extremely dangerous and is almost guaranteed to open up a mile-wide security hole.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>C# to C++ Tutorial - Part 1: Basics of Syntax</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2011 04:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-1-basics-of-syntax/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[ &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; · &lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-2-pointers/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-3-classes-and/"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;a href="https://erikmcclure.com/blog/c-to-c-tutorial-part-4-operator-overload/"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="color:#aaa;"&gt;· 5 · 6 · 7&lt;/span&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When moving from C# to C++, one must have a very deep knowledge of what C# is actually doing when you run your program.

A &lt;code&gt;heisenbug&lt;/code&gt; is defined as a bug that vanishes when you try to find it. It took me almost a day to trace the bug to the &lt;code&gt;rebalance&lt;/code&gt; function. At first I thought the image had simply been removed from a node accidentally, but this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case. It took another day to finally figure out that the &lt;code&gt;numimages&lt;/code&gt; variable was getting set to 0, thus causing the node to think it was empty and resulted in it deleting itself and removing itself from the tree (which caused all sorts of other problems).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Investigating Low-level CPU Performance</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/investigating-low-level-cpu-performance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2011 17:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/investigating-low-level-cpu-performance/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While reconstructing my threaded Red-Black tree data structure, I naturally assumed that due to invalid branch predictions costing significant amounts of performance, by eliminating branching in low-level data structures, one can significant enhance the performance of your application.

&lt;li&gt;No more handwriting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more setting your name to anything other then your first and last name.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All photosharing is now incompatible with previous versions of messenger, and instead of actually just sending the file, it will instead fail completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any youtube video, image, or any other link you copy paste into the window will automatically trigger a sharing session whether you like it or not.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s new emoticons must have been influenced by H.R.Giger (you can&amp;rsquo;t turn them off and leave custom ones on).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to put up with this for very long and moved to pidgin. Pidgin has many issues of its own, including an ass-backwards UI design and this really annoying tendency to create a new popup window to confirm every single file transfer, among other truly bizarre UI design elements. I was willing to put up with these, because honestly pidgin is designed for Linux and just happens to work on windows too, and their libpurple library is the basis of almost all open-source IM clients.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Album For Sale!

It contains remastered, super high quality (lossless if you choose to download in FLAC format) versions of all 14 songs, in addition to the original FLP project files used to create them. If you have ever wondered how I made a particular song, this might be another incentive to purchase the album. Note that these FLPs are released under the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0&lt;/a&gt; license, so you can&amp;rsquo;t go running off with them like free candy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WavSaver</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/wavsaver/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2010 19:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/wavsaver/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is a documented bug in windows 7 that has pissed me off a few times and recently crippled a friend of mine, where a .wav file with corrupted metadata causes explorer.exe to go into an infinite loop. My friend has a large collection of wavs that somehow got corrupted, so I wrote this program to strip them of all metadata. Due to the nature of the bug, the program can&amp;rsquo;t delete them (you must use the command prompt to do that), but rather creates a folder called &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; with all the stripped wav files inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pixel Perfect Hit Testing</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pixel-perfect-hit-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2010 06:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pixel-perfect-hit-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After beating World of Goo after stabilizing things in my game and renaming it, I wondered how easy it was to decompile C# applications and simultaneously thought this would be a great opportunity to get pixel perfect hit testing to work on my engine. So, I decompiled GearGOD&amp;rsquo;s composition example and quickly discovered that his method of detecting mouse messages was&amp;hellip; well something completely different then his extremely bad attempt at explaining it to me had suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>8-bit color cycling</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/8-bit-color-cycling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 07:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/8-bit-color-cycling/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Someone linked me to this awesome webpage that uses HTML5 to do 8-bit palette color cycling using Mark Ferrari&amp;rsquo;s technique and art. I immediately wanted to implement it in my graphics engine, but soon realized that the technique is so damn old that no modern graphics card supports it anymore. So, I have come up with a pixel shader that creates the same functionality, either by having one image with an alpha channel containing the palette indices and a separate texture acting as the palette, or you can combine them into a single image. This is supposed to support variable palette sizes (up to 256) but I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much ability to test the thing because its so damn hard to get the images formatted correctly. So while all of these variations i&amp;rsquo;m about to show you should work there is no guarantee they necessarily will.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Physics Networking</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-networking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2010 04:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-networking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still working on integrating physics into my game, but at some point here I am going to hit on that one major hurdle: syncing one physics environment with another that could be halfway across the globe. There are a number of ways to do this; some of them are bad, and some of them are absolutely terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of you have played Transformice, you will know what I mean by terrible. While I did decompile the game, I never bothered to examine their networking code, but I would speculate that they are simply mass-updating all the clients and not properly interpolating received packets. Consequently, when things get laggy, everyone doesn&amp;rsquo;t just hop around, they completely clip through objects, even ones that they should never clip though &lt;em&gt;no matter what the other players are doing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assembly CAS implementation</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/assembly-cas-implementation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2010 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/assembly-cas-implementation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="language-cpp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline unsigned char BSS_FASTCALL asmcas(int *pval, int newval, int oldval)

This was an absolute bitch to get working in VC++, so maybe this will be useful to someone, somewhere, somehow. The GCC version I based this off of can be found &lt;a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2005/Projects/P3/cas.c"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Function Pointer Speed</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/function-pointer-speed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2010 22:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/function-pointer-speed/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So after a lot of misguided profiling where I ended up just testing the stupid CPU cache and its ability to fucking predict what my code is going to do, I have, for the most part, demonstrated the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if(!(rand()%2d)) footest.nothing();
else footest.nothing2();&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is slightly faster then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(footest.*funcptr[rand()%2])();&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where funcptr is an array of the possible function calls. I had suspected this after I looked at the assembly, and a basic function pointer call like that takes around 11 instructions whereas a normal function call takes a single instruction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Most Bizarre Error Ever</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/most-bizarre-error-ever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2010 00:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/most-bizarre-error-ever/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ok probably not the most bizarre error &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely the weirdest for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My graphics engine has a Debug, a Release, and a special Release STD version that&amp;rsquo;s compatible with CLI function requirements and other dependencies. These are organized as 3 separate configurations in my solution for compiling. Pretty normal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My example applications are all set to be dependent on the graphics engine project, which means visual studio automatically compiles the proper lib file into the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Physics-oriented Network Interpolation</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-oriented-network-interpolation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2009 11:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-oriented-network-interpolation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Syncing a game over a client server connection is not an easy task. It&amp;rsquo;s actually extraordinarily difficult and is almost completely reliant on the quality of interpolation. Due to the nature of interpolation, it gets exponentially more inaccurate the more time is spent doing it. Therefore, a game designer should want to minimize the amount needed. This is not an easy task, but it usually involves using the server as a middleman to halve the interpolation time. The only issue with this is that the server&amp;rsquo;s interpolation becomes reality, so while a client interpolation can be fairly inaccurate and simply corrected later on, the server&amp;rsquo;s world is reality.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
