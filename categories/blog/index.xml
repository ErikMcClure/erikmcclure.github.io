This is called forming a political coalition, a temporary alliance to achieve a common goal. Importantly, you must understand that a political party is not and will never be a cohesive collection of people who all agree with each other.</description></item><item><title>The New Discord Overlay Breaks GSync and Borderless Optimizations</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-overlay-breaks-gsync/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 17:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-overlay-breaks-gsync/</guid><description>The new discord overlay no longer uses DLL injection, and is instead a permanent HWND_TOPMOST window glued to whatever window it happens to think is a game. Ignoring the fact that discord seems to think FL Studio, the minecraft launcher, and SteamVR&amp;rsquo;s desktop widget are &amp;ldquo;video games&amp;rdquo;, the real problem is that this breaks the Borderless Windowed Optimizations, which has the most obvious effect of disabling GSync/FreeSync on all games that the overlay enables itself on.</description></item><item><title>Do You Really Think We'll Have Genders In The Future?</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/do-you-really-think-we-have-gender-in-the-future/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/do-you-really-think-we-have-gender-in-the-future/</guid><description>Something that is very common is for people pushing the boundaries of technology (or pretending to, anyway) to hold weirdly conservative social views.

I am now knee-deep in several very complex Rust projects that keep slamming into the limitations of the Rust compiler. One of the most common and obnoxious problems is hitting a situation the borrow-checker can&amp;rsquo;t deal with and realizing that I need to completely re-architect how my program works, because lifetimes are &amp;ldquo;contagious&amp;rdquo; the same way async is. Naturally, Rust has both!</description></item><item><title>Rust Async Makes Me Want To Gouge My Eyes Out</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/rust-async-makes-me-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/rust-async-makes-me-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out/</guid><description>One of the most fundamental problems with Rust is the design of Result. It is a lightweight, standardized error return value, similar to C-style error codes but implemented at a type system level that can contain arbitrary information. They are easy to use and very useful, and the ecosystem encourages you to use them over panic! whenever possible. Unfortunately, this ends up creating a problem. Result is not like a C++ exception because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain a stacktrace by default, nor does the compiler have any idea where it was first constructed, unless the error type it contains decides to include that information upon construction by using backtrace.</description></item><item><title>Engineers Only Get Paid If Something Is Broken</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/engineers-only-get-paid-something-broken/</guid><description>*shaking voice*

Combined with Hanlon&amp;rsquo;s Razor, we arrive at the inescapable conclusion that most problems are caused by incompetence. What&amp;rsquo;s particularly interesting is that the number of incompetent people in a system tends to increase the higher up you go. Part of this is due to the Peter Principle, where organizations promote employees until they become incompetent, but this happens in the first place because it becomes harder to measure competence&amp;rsquo; the longer it takes the effects of actions to be felt, and as a species we have no way of measuring long-term incompetence.</description></item><item><title>We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/</guid><description>[programmers frantically pulling cables out of the wall]

Of course, they also don&amp;rsquo;t know that it&amp;rsquo;s generally considered poor taste to interject like this, as it tends to annoy everyone and almost always fails to take into consideration the greater context in which someone might be using Windows, or Mac, or TikTok, or Twitter, or whatever corporate hellscape they are trapped in.</description></item><item><title>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 13:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/</guid><description>Discord&amp;rsquo;s Recent Announcement made a lot of people mad, mostly because of Hyrum&amp;rsquo;s Law - users were relying on unintended observable behavior in the original username system, and are mad that their use-cases are being broken despite very good evidence that the current system is problematic. I think the major issue here is that Discord didn&amp;rsquo;t go far enough, and as a result, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing users who are unaware of the technical and practical reasons for the username change, or what a username is even for.</description></item><item><title>Money Is Fake.

One consequence of this has been an increased emphasis on Open Source Contributions, but it turns out these aren&amp;rsquo;t a very good metric either, because most people don&amp;rsquo;t have that kind of time.</description></item><item><title>Why You Can't Use Prebuilt LLVM 10.0 with C++17</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 02:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/why-you-cant-use-prebuilt-llvm-with-cpp17/</guid><description>C++17 introduced an alignment argument to ::operator new(). It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that if you allocate something using aligned new, you absolutely must deallocate it using aligned delete, or the behavior is undefined. LLVM 10.x takes advantage of this alignment parameter, if the compiler supports it. That means if you are compiling on Windows with MSVC set to C++14, __cpp_aligned_new is not defined and the extra argument isn&amp;rsquo;t passed. Otherwise, if it&amp;rsquo;s compiled with MSVC set to C++17, __cpp_aligned_new is defined and the extra argument is passed.</description></item><item><title>Pressure Based Anti-Spam for Discord Bots</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pressure-based-anti-spam-for-discord-bots/</guid><description>Back when Discord was a wee little chat platform with no rate limiting whatsoever, it&amp;rsquo;s API had already been reverse-engineered by a bunch of bot developers who then went around spamming random servers with so many messages it would crash the client. My friends and I were determined to keep our discord server public, so I went about creating the first anti-spam bot for Discord.
I am no longer maintaining this bot beyond simple bugfixes because I have better things to do with my time, and I&amp;rsquo;m tired of people trying to use it because &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s the best anti-spam bot&amp;rdquo; even after I deprecated it.</description></item><item><title>Name Shadowing Should Be An Operator</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/name-shadowing-should-be-an-operator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2019 13:23:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/name-shadowing-should-be-an-operator/</guid><description>I recently discovered that in Rust, this is a relatively common operation: let foo = String::from(&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;); // stuff that needs ownership let foo = &amp;amp;foo; Or this: let mut vec = Vec::new(); vec.push(&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;); vec.push(&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;); let vec = vec; /* vec is immutable now */ This is a particularly permissive form of name-shadowing, which allows you to re-declare a variable in an inner scope that shadows the name of a variable in an outer scope, making the outer variable inaccessible.</description></item><item><title>A Rant On Terra</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/a-rant-on-terra/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 17:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/a-rant-on-terra/</guid><description>Metaprogramming, or the ability to inspect, modify and generate code at compile-time (as opposed to reflection, which is runtime introspection of code), has slowly been gaining momentum.

If you are familiar with C#, you should be familiar with the difference between C#&amp;rsquo;s struct and class declarations. Namely, a struct is a value type and a class is a reference type, meaning that if you pass a struct to a function, its default behavior is for the entire struct to be copied into the function&amp;rsquo;s parameter, so any modifications made to it won&amp;rsquo;t affect whatever was passed in.</description></item><item><title>7 Problems Raytracing Doesn't Solve</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/7-problems-raytracing-doesnt-solve/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2012 04:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/7-problems-raytracing-doesnt-solve/</guid><description>I see a lot of people get excited about extreme concurrency in modern hardware bringing us closer to the magical holy grail of raytracing.

[Renascent]</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/album-for-sale-renascent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2010 01:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/album-for-sale-renascent/</guid><description>Due to Bandcamp&amp;rsquo;s sudden threat to turn all of my free downloads into paid ones, I decided to go ahead and start selling my music properly. Renascent is now available for $3, or about as much as a gallon of milk costs. It contains remastered, super high quality (lossless if you choose to download in FLAC format) versions of all 14 songs, in addition to the original FLP project files used to create them.</description></item><item><title>WavSaver</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/wavsaver/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2010 19:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/wavsaver/</guid><description>There is a documented bug in windows 7 that has pissed me off a few times and recently crippled a friend of mine, where a .wav file with corrupted metadata causes explorer.exe to go into an infinite loop. My friend has a large collection of wavs that somehow got corrupted, so I wrote this program to strip them of all metadata. Due to the nature of the bug, the program can&amp;rsquo;t delete them (you must use the command prompt to do that), but rather creates a folder called &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; with all the stripped wav files inside of it.</description></item><item><title>Pixel Perfect Hit Testing</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pixel-perfect-hit-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2010 06:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/pixel-perfect-hit-testing/</guid><description>After beating World of Goo after stabilizing things in my game and renaming it, I wondered how easy it was to decompile C# applications and simultaneously thought this would be a great opportunity to get pixel perfect hit testing to work on my engine. So, I decompiled GearGOD&amp;rsquo;s composition example and quickly discovered that his method of detecting mouse messages was&amp;hellip; well something completely different then his extremely bad attempt at explaining it to me had suggested.</description></item><item><title>8-bit color cycling</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/8-bit-color-cycling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 07:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/8-bit-color-cycling/</guid><description>Someone linked me to this awesome webpage that uses HTML5 to do 8-bit palette color cycling using Mark Ferrari&amp;rsquo;s technique and art. I immediately wanted to implement it in my graphics engine, but soon realized that the technique is so damn old that no modern graphics card supports it anymore. So, I have come up with a pixel shader that creates the same functionality, either by having one image with an alpha channel containing the palette indices and a separate texture acting as the palette, or you can combine them into a single image.</description></item><item><title>Physics Networking</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-networking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2010 04:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-networking/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m still working on integrating physics into my game, but at some point here I am going to hit on that one major hurdle: syncing one physics environment with another that could be halfway across the globe. There are a number of ways to do this; some of them are bad, and some of them are absolutely terrible.
If any of you have played Transformice, you will know what I mean by terrible.</description></item><item><title>Assembly CAS implementation</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/assembly-cas-implementation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2010 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/assembly-cas-implementation/</guid><description>inline unsigned char BSS_FASTCALL asmcas(int *pval, int newval, int oldval) { unsigned char rval; __asm { #ifdef BSS_NO_FASTCALL //if we are using fastcall we don&amp;#39;t need these instructions mov EDX, newval mov ECX, pval #endif mov EAX, oldval lock cmpxchg [ECX], EDX sete rval // Note that sete sets a &amp;#39;byte&amp;#39; not the word } return rval; } This was an absolute bitch to get working in VC++, so maybe this will be useful to someone, somewhere, somehow.</description></item><item><title>Function Pointer Speed</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/function-pointer-speed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2010 22:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/function-pointer-speed/</guid><description>So after a lot of misguided profiling where I ended up just testing the stupid CPU cache and its ability to fucking predict what my code is going to do, I have, for the most part, demonstrated the following:
if(!(rand()%2d)) footest.nothing(); else footest.nothing2(); is slightly faster then
(footest.*funcptr[rand()%2])(); where funcptr is an array of the possible function calls. I had suspected this after I looked at the assembly, and a basic function pointer call like that takes around 11 instructions whereas a normal function call takes a single instruction.</description></item><item><title>Most Bizarre Error Ever</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/most-bizarre-error-ever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2010 00:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/most-bizarre-error-ever/</guid><description>Ok probably not the most bizarre error ever but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely the weirdest for me.
My graphics engine has a Debug, a Release, and a special Release STD version that&amp;rsquo;s compatible with CLI function requirements and other dependencies. These are organized as 3 separate configurations in my solution for compiling. Pretty normal stuff.
My example applications are all set to be dependent on the graphics engine project, which means visual studio automatically compiles the proper lib file into the project.</description></item><item><title>Physics-oriented Network Interpolation</title><link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-oriented-network-interpolation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2009 11:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/physics-oriented-network-interpolation/</guid><description>Syncing a game over a client server connection is not an easy task. It&amp;rsquo;s actually extraordinarily difficult and is almost completely reliant on the quality of interpolation. Due to the nature of interpolation, it gets exponentially more inaccurate the more time is spent doing it. Therefore, a game designer should want to minimize the amount needed. This is not an easy task, but it usually involves using the server as a middleman to halve the interpolation time.</description></item></channel></rss>
