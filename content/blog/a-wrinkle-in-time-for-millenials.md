A Wrinkle In Time is one of my favorite books from my childhood. I re-read it multiple times over the years, and while I was initially fascinated by the fantastic world presented, as I grew older I came to recognize the book as a meditation on the dangers of conformity and security. Because the book was published in the 1960s, it is often viewed in the context of the cold war, and it is easy to mistake it's plot as a warning against the dangers of communism. However, the book's own author and a [3 page essay removed from the original version](http://graphics.wsj.com/documents/doc-cloud-embedder/?sidebar=1#1881486-a-wrinkle-in-time-excerpt) make it clear that it is about *conformity* and how totalitarianism can arise from a misplaced desire for security, even in a democratic society. In fact, one reason that essay was removed was because it was far too heavy-handed, laying this all out in a surprisingly blunt manner, unlike the rest of the book.

Looking at this excerpt now, it seems like a direct commentary on the current state of politics, as the United States descends further and further into a totalitarian mentality, driven by fear and hatred.
