The philosophical definitions of people's various stances on the existence of God:

**Athiest**: There is no god.
**Theist**: There must be a god.
**Agnostic**: We cannot know if god exists.

Concurrently, if you are an atheist, you must **PROVE** that god does not exist. The same thing goes for Theists. This has the interesting implication of poking a giant hole in Pascal's Wager: If there isn't a god and you don't go to church, you cease to exist. On the other hand, if there is a god and you don't go to church, you get sent to hell. Therefore its better to believe in god "just in case." Philosophers don't give a crap about that - philosophers only care about which point of view has a set of logical reasons that can be proved.

Following this logic, I think a huge number of people are actually Agnostics that either choose to believe in Atheism or choose to believe in Theism for their own personal reasons, and yet their *logical reasoning* is **exactly the same.** What's the point of this?

We are no longer arguing about the existence of god. We are instead arguing about ***which point of view is more beneficial to humanity in general?***
