I've seen this sentiment a few times, and it's painful to read. It belies a fundamental misunderstanding of how capitalism works, and if you want to maximize your positive impact, you're gonna have to play the current economic system. In capitalism **the more money you have, the more money you make**. Period. How much money your make from your current savings depends on how effective you are at *investing* that money. In this article, I'm going to explain why rent is bad, and what it means to invest something. Then we can explore several different ways to help others by *investing* instead of donating.

## Renting

Pretty much everyone under the age of 40 is painfully aware of what renting means. To rent something means you are borrowing it - you don't own it. Let's say you're renting a hammer for an hour instead of buying one, for some reason. In economic terms, this means the cost of renting the hammer should be the value you gain by having the hammer, plus whatever logistics costs the "hammer renter" has. Generally speaking, this means renting a hammer for a few hours should be significantly cheaper than buying one outright, but prohibitively expensive if you were to rent a hammer the entire expected lifetime of buying one. 

To compare the expected utility of renting vs. buying, we have to look at long-term expected value:
* Cost of occasionally renting a hammer over 10 years: N hours of renting cost - inconvenience of going out and renting it and coming back.
* Cost of buying a hammer expected to last 10 years: Cost of buying it once - inconvenience of having to store it somewhere.

So, ignoring the logistics of having to store something you buy, in general, if the number of hours you expect to rent something exceeds the cost of buying it outright, you should buy it. This gives us a simple equation:

\[ R * H < B \]

As a concrete example, say I just moved to a new apartment - I need a modem to be able to use my internet. I can buy a modem for $240, or I can rent one for $10 a month. I expect to be in this apartment for at least 2 years, but I also know that if I'm renting a modem, and Comcast comes out with a new modem, they'll upgrade it for free. If I expect Comcast to upgrade their modem in a year, then I'd be buying one for $240 that would only last me a year, so it'd be better to rent it, which costs $120 per year. However, if Comcast just came out with a new modem, I should buy the modem, because if I stay in this apartment for longer than 2 years, the cost of renting will exceed the cost of buying the modem.

This mental math exercise will be familiar to most people who have tried to figure out whether or not to rent or buy something. **But we're missing something.**

## Buying

Let's talk about houses. Buying a house has gotten much more difficult for this generation because the centralization of jobs in cities means that the higher population density results in skyrocketing housing costs, despite the fact that the united states population growth is [slowing down](#). On it's face, renting vs. buying a house is a simple equation: if you expect to live somewhere long enough that the cost of renting exceeds the cost of a house, you should buy a house.

The average rent in the Greater Seattle Area for a 3-bedroom apartment big enough for a family of 3 (two parents and one child) is generally $2000-$3000 a month. A home with 3 bedrooms *starts* at around $400,000 and goes up from there. If we take an average apartment of $2500 per month and a home that costs about $500,000, this tells us that it would take *16 years of renting* to equal the cost of a house. So this is easy, right? If you expect to live somewhere more than 15 years, buy a house. Otherwise, rent!

**WRONG.** You can **sell the house.* *

Our renting equation up there made a critical mistake - we are ignoring the fact that you can **sell something after you've bought it**, for the price of what you bought it for minus the amount it's value has depreciated over time. For things like a router, it's value can depreciate fairly rapidly as it is made obsolete, so it's sale value by the end of it's life is often near zero.

\[ R * H < B - (D * H) \]

However, for something like a house, the value of a house **tends to increase** ($$D$$ is negative, meaning you can sell it for more than you bought it). That completely flips the equation on the head, because that means if you can afford a house and intend to live anywhere for at least a few years, *you should buy a house*.

### Mortgages

Of course, the value of a house only really increases after you've paid off the mortgage. What's a mortgage? A mortgage is the acknoledgement that basically nobody can actually afford to buy a house even if they know they're going to be

## Assets

I'm going to be straight with you - our rent equation up there still isn't accurate. Even if something depreciates in value, like a hammer, if you *own* that hammer, then it as an **asset** that you can *rent to other people*.

Now we're getting into the "capital" part of "capitalism". Private property in capitalism is not just about renting vs. buying, it's about **investment**. When you buy a hammer, you are *investing in the hammer*. Your investment can pay off in two ways: just using the hammer like a normal person, or *renting the hammer out* to other people who might need a hammer. This is how businesses work - you use money, to buy capital, then utilize the capital to make more money, to buy more capital, to make more money. 

## Ownership

It should be obvious at this point that the problem with renting anything for a significant amount of time is that *you don't own it*. This is a problem endemic to our current economy, because companies know how they make money. They're doing this *on purpose*. Companies want to own everything and rent it out forever because this is how you maximize profit. It's also maximimally harmful to everyone else whose stuck renting things.

When you rent something, you are setting your money on fire for the privilege of temporarily using something. You get nothing out of it. The thing you are renting cannot make money for you (and in fact many companies will specifically prevent you from renting out something you rented from them). No increase in value can happen. No investment occurs.

## Action

So, if you are making $100,000 and you give away half of it so you and a friend can rent apartments, you are *burning money for no reason*. If you have $100,000 you can accomplish a lot more by *investing* the $50,000 you don't need to survive. **Your first goal should be to buy a house.** Invest or save up your money until you have enough money to get a mortgage and buy a house. This replaces **rent** with a **mortgage**. Now, debt is still bad, but as we discussed before, mortgages are special because they're debt on something whose value increases over time anyway. By buying a house, you can reduce the total amount of rent you're paying, and if you rent out a room to someone for cheap (or for free!) then you have now reduced *their* total rent costs.

**Your goal is to minimize rent costs**. Here are some ways you can invest your money and help other people reduce or eliminate their own rent costs.

### Invest in yourself

### Buy a house

### Rent rooms for cheap

### Invest in the stock market

### Help someone buy a house

### Start or help start a company

### Buy land and build a commune
