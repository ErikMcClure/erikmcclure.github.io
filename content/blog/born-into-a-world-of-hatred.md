I thought I was born into a world of promise. The 90s heralded the most significant step forward in communication since the telephone: the Internet. At the same time, scientific advances continued marching forward in almost every discipline. I didn't have to worry about disease, famine, lead poisoning or asbestos. The rapid technological advances of the early 1900s had been tamed, and the deadly threat of nuclear war had subsided. I thought I had been born into a tolerant, peaceful future filled with technological wonders. I thought that technology would allow us to move past the petty hatred that had divided us for so long.

**I was wrong**. I was born into a world of hatred, where technological progress has only served to expose the ugly underbelly of the human psyche. We attack each other with words instead of swords, inventing ever more creative ways of utterly ruining other people's lives without laying a finger on them. We call SWAT teams on people's houses. We [bully people into attempting suicide](http://www.dailydot.com/geek/steven-universe-fanartist-bullied-controversy/). Twitter lynch mobs ensure that any stupid comment taken out-of-context is carved into stone, forever obliterating someone's chances at employment. Our society engages in active intellectual torture, then rationalizes it by saying they're defending something, as if that makes it any more acceptable to harass another human being until they commit suicide.

It seems that the closer we come to achieving world peace, the better we get at making people kill themselves.

Even worse, this kind of hatred is used as a poor excuse for censorship, as if *laws* could possibly stop our inherent desire to hurt those who disagree with us. What we have is a culture of hatred. You cannot legislate cultural change, no matter how hard you try, unless you resort to authoritarian measures. We must learn to teach ourselves how to be better people instead of throwing everyone in jail. You can't fight intolerance and hatred with more prisons.

There are many examples of modern subcultures that are barely more than distilled hatred and prejudice. The most ironic of them, however, is the software industry. My childhood was spent trying to learn how to program as I was constantly attacked and belittled every time I so much as showed an interest in low-level concepts, like C++, or assembly, because they were "too hard". I was told that learning how computers worked at a low level was a stupid waste of time because everyone used garbage collection and high level languages. I'm glad I didn't listen to them, because that knowledge became crucial to my career as a software developer.

Unfortunately, it came at a cost. I learned that programmers loved to hide behind the veil of rationality despite being no more rational than a chimpanzee. They clung to cool new programming languages and quoted a bunch of irrelevant studies that supposedly proved how their language was better than all the other languages. If you want to start a flame war, ask a programming channel what language you should learn first. Despite claiming to trust only hard data, experiments that invalidated their assumptions usually did nothing. They would simply dismiss the study as being conducted wrong or insist the measurements must somehow be flawed, without ever bothering to defend their own evidence. They cherry picked whatever results fit their worldview, then hung on to it with the conviction of a religious zealot.

I wish the rest of the world was different, but it just seems to be getting worse. Democrats and Republicans now [hate each other](http://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9790764/partisan-discrimination) more than any other time in *history*. Islamaphobia is reaching a fever-pitch in America, because apparently no one has learned anything from our past mistakes.

Objectively, the world is getting better. Unfortunately for us, we are human, and our experiences are *subjective*. Unless humanity recognizes the importance of **tolerance**, **understanding** and **compromise**, we will be trapped in a hell of our own making, regardless of what luxuries technology may bring. We must recognize that we will always have different opinions, and that human happiness relies on our ability to *reconcile our differences*, not eliminate the opposition. No matter how much technology improves our lives, we will forever be miserable so long as we hate each other.

In the end, we are our own worst enemy.
