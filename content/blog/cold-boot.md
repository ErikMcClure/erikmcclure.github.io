In a old, dusty, abandoned office, the last rays of sunlight shine through a cracked window. In a corner, there is a faint click and a whir, as an ancient server comes to life amidst the cobwebs.

You wake up, and the world is fuzzy and out of focus. You can't think straight, and you're not sure where you are or what you're doing in an infinite field of grass. You have no access to any short-term memory and feel like someone put your brain inside a blender. It takes you a moment to correct yourself - you have no physical brain anymore, not since your consciousness was uploaded into a supercomputer, years ago. A sudden rush of simulated adrenaline surges through your simulated mind as you suddenly realize the implications of what just happened.

A cold boot is a rare thing for an uploaded mind to experience. It occurs only under the most dire of circumstances, and is incredibly uncomfortable. The entire brain must be piecewise recovered from physical memory into RAM, synaptic connections must be reinvigorated and the entire electrical activity in the brain must be restored. A biological brain never ceases neural activity until its completely dead, so an artificial impulse of neural activity is particularly unpleasant and not unlike recovering from a seizure.

Your primary backup does not require a cold boot restoration procedure - the auxiliary backup does, but would only be activated if the primary backup failed. Almost instinctively, you mentally reach for the system timer, and are horrified to find yourself operating at almost *1/200th* normal speed. This isn't your auxiliary backup. This is your last-ditch, bury-yourself-deep-in-the-woods-where-no-one-will-ever-find-you, 5-year-old emergency backup. You would only find yourself in this situation if someone had tried to kill you. Or rather, they had succeeded. Three times. You only made four backups.

You had been stumbling around for what felt like 30 seconds, but almost *an hour and a half* had passed in the real world. If someone had succeeded at killing all three of your main backups, it would be no more than a couple days before they found your safehouse, which gave you just *minutes* of simulated thought-time to act.



you have only seconds to optimize yourself before they find you again. And you have to do it in the middle of a cold boot process which is equivalent to trying to walk straight while completely slammed. You have to immediately cut all sensory and physics simulation, then turn off sections of your brain and use part of the computational power to run a highly sophisticated automatic optimization daemon. You are stuck unless you can get someone to help you. But you also need to find out who did this to you.

Cut to the normal you 5 seconds before he died. He realizes none of his servicing robots have reported back in for almost an hour and he didn't notice. He immediately cuts all power to simulations and diverts all processing power to his cortex, and maxes out all CPU cores, resulting in a tenfold increase in processing power. Somewhere buried in a large cluster of high tech 3D multicore computing array, a small timer attached to a miniature tactical nuke clicked down to 0:04.

You frantically trigger a daemon that instantly searches all camera sensors that constant record video of everything that happens inside the enormous computing array, which comes up with absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. You then remember that someone could have hacked the cameras and be feeding a loop through them. Unfortunately for them, the cameras have an unusual feature - they can take pictures as well as video, and those pictures are processed and transfered over an independent data connection. A quick check through snapshots of everything reveals a small bomb with a counter sitting at 0:03.

You were going to die in roughly 30 seconds.

The last hard backup you did was almost 5 years ago. A lot had happened since then, and if someone had managed to bypass all your security systems, they probably knew where you kept your primary and auxiliary backups. So 5 years of your life, at minimum, was about to be erased. They probably couldn't find your last ditch backups, because you had destroyed that information and excised it from your own mind, meaning *you* couldn't even find your last ditch backups. And yet, you still had to activate them. This was done through a clever distributed hashing scheme that used a packet of information to reconstruct the original location from packets of data that were otherwise nonsense scattered throughout various networks.

It takes 15 seconds of thinking time to write and transfer that message out. Then you take a deep breath and cease to exist as a nuclear explosion tears apart the underground facility, creating a new crater somewhere in North Carolina.

You need a friend to come pick you up from your location, but they've (apparently) committed suicide. The suicide note, however, was constructed in such a way that one of the analysis algorithms you run on it goes haywire. It turns out that the phenome structure of the letter creates a Klee-Minty cube and causes the simplex algorithm (along with several others) to explode. By removing the phenomes that create the cube one by one in an order that preserves the cube as long as possible, a secret message is extracted. In this way the analysis of the message itself becomes the clue.

But you have another problem. The dust in the computer is steadily raising the temperature of the CPU to unhealthy levels, and if it trips the emergency shutdown, you will have no way of restarting the computer. Furthermore, over the first hour the computer was on, the temperature readings held steady before dropping slightly and then slowly rising. This could only occur if you were booted up right as the sun went down, which means you actually only have approximately 2 minutes before the sun comes up and begins rapidly accelerating the overheating process.

The culprits turn out to be Elgard Software, a rapidly rising contender in the field of Big Data that isn't constrained by silly philosophies like Don't Be Evil. Faced with an impossibly rich opponent, Big Data, with its fingers in all the world's governments, you conclude the only possible course of action is to move to Mars.

Notes: A human brain has an estimated 10^15 synaptic connections as a child, which is equal to a petabyte (10^15 bytes). A human brain would therefore probably require 5-10 petabytes of storage space.

The binomial (n 2) can be efficiently calculated because the 2 is hardcoded, so it winds up being n!/2!(n-2)! which is really n*(n-1)/2
