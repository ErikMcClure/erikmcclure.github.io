title = "Democrats Don't Understand Statistics"

+++
Barack Obama recently warned against endorsing policy proposals that were "too far left", saying that democrats have to appeal to centrist moderates in order to win the election. It comes after Nancy Pelosi's continued war against progressives in her own party, justifying her actions with the same sentiment: democrats win elections by winning over moderates in swing states.

**This is completely false**. Obama won both his terms by energizing previously disengaged voters in swing states that flipped them blue. Furthermore, Trump won not because people voted for him over Clinton, but because Clinton was such a bad candidate that democrats just didn't vote at all. The fact that democrats continue to ignore this is simply evidence that _they do not understand statistics_.

The exact demographics at play here are a bit more specific: Democrats win elections when youth turnout is high. Republicans win elections when youth turnout is low. The actual Republican turnout, however, is almost always the same. Statistically, youth don't "choose" between republicans and democrats, they either always vote republican, or choose between voting democrat versus not at all (for the sake of analysis here, we count voting for third parties as not voting at all, because under a first-past-the-post voting system they are mathematically equivalent - if you don't like that, you should support ranked voting). Democratic voters determine the winner of an election by how engaged they are. Republicans just vote Republican all the time.

Moderates, of course, do exist, and can be important in close local races, but they are no longer the statistically dominant factor in presidential races. The simple fact is that 70% of Americans don't even vote. The 5% figure quoted as the "moderates" is in fact 5% of 30%, which is just _1.5%_ of the total population. Converting 5% of the 70% of disengaged voters gives you _twice the number of votes_ than the moderates, which means the democrats have it completely backwards:

How did we get into this situation? The simple answer is "Sampling Bias". It's why Nate Silver was wrong about Trump. It's why some democrats actually thought Hillary had a chance of winning. Almost all the sampling bias comes from _polls_, which are basically just surveys given to random people. The most obvious problem with modern polls is that many of them _only call landlines_. This means you probably aren't polling one of the most important demographic groups: the youth vote. Even if you start calling cell phones, young Americans also more likely to assume it's a telemarketing scam. This is such a blatant and obvious problem that it's not worth spending time on. Instead, we're going to focus on a more subtle sampling error that is an even bigger problem.

**Polls only sample _engaged voters_**. The implicit assumption being made here is that elections are usually determined by engaged voters. This assumption can be violated if the number of engaged voters suddenly increases _or decreases_. This is what happened in 2016 - the number of engaged voters dropped off a cliff and the republicans won because all the statistics were based on hopelessly flawed methodologies. We got lots of polls saying that all the democrats who intended to vote were going to vote for Clinton, but we didn't get any polls talking about all the democrats who just _weren't going to vote at all_.

For the sake of argument, I've made a point of trying to get most of the numbers in this article correct by using reliable sources, but the truth is that the numbers don't matter. **You will never get the right answer if you're analyzing the wrong problem**. Unless Democrats recognize they have catastrophic sampling bias errors, they will continue to lose elections they should have won. Luckily, most people aren't listening to Nancy Pelosi, and Democrats have won across the country by endorsing progressive ideals and energizing the voters. The Democrats who are winning know that the moderates don't win them elections - the disenfranchised, the forgotten and the poor win elections.  
  
The Republicans just vote Republican. Stop trying to appeal to them.
