I am an atheist, and while many atheists derive their moral framework from what I would call "basic human decency", I prefer to derive my moral framework from a consistent logical basis. My morals are derived from one basic observation: I should not treat anyone badly simply because they are in a bad position that I can take advantage of, because I might find myself in that position and I don't want to be mistreated myself. Put more simply, this is the golden rule: Treat others as you want to be treated.

The golden rule is not sufficient to derive an entire moral framework. Instead, there are several additional assumptions that must be made. You must take into account that someone who is not you may not share your desires, and consequently if you want them to treat you as you wish to be treated, you must treat them as they wish to be treated, regardless of what you might want if you were in that position. In addition, you must take into account the *context* of someone's actions. It is not fair to judge a drunk person's judgement the same as a sober person, and this is precisely why most human beings are more lenient with drunkards doing stupid things. Someone's *current position* must be taken into account when you decide how you treat them.

One last crucial assumption must be made: If what we value is our own self-awareness, we must assume that whatever our "consciousness" is has a statistically equal chance of being born into any human being, anywhere in the world, and that we have *absolutely no input* on this random chance. This tenet is crucial for recognizing that, if we are lucky enough to not be born with a crippling disability, we should still strive to assist those that do, because *we could have been them*, through events that were completely out of our control, like being dropped on our heads as a baby.

These are the core tenets I use to construct my entire moral framework, and they are what I refer back to when a new situation arises that I am unsure of. Unfortunately, many people hold moral beliefs that either have no logical basis, or are completely self-contradictory. Despite this, many people continue to claim that logic cannot be used to derive morality, even when their own moral stances are mutually incompatible.

What's usually brought up is some sort of edge case, like [abortion](), which has no easy moral answer that can be derived. However, I don't think abortion invalidates anything. I think the abortion debate has no easy answer precisely because there is no solution that is morally superior to any other solution. Anyone who claims they have an answer to abortion is simply picking one side and arbitrarily deciding its the right one. That doesn't help anyone. It doesn't prove anything. It just means you gave up trying to figure it out and picked a side.

Some try to resolve more ambiguous situations like abortion using utilitarianism, which is usually criticized by constructing a scenario where one person is made to suffer a ridiculous amount so that nobody else has to suffer. I have serious issues with this concept, because it seems entirely based on the assumption that suffering is a linear function, which is ridiculous. All humans suffer to some extent, but "suffer" here can include silly things like stubbing your toe, or spilling your coffee. Humans have an innate ability to shrug off a certain amount of suffering without too much trouble. It's *extreme* suffering that we are truly worried about. Humans naturally exhibit this behavior, where we instinctively try to lessen the burden on our fellow humans by parceling it out among ourselves. A group of humans is willing to put up with a small increase in suffering to significantly decrease the suffering of one of their friends. We do this because suffering is nonlinear, and if we can't get rid of all suffering we'd rather split it up as much as possible instead of making one poor human suffer for us.

To this end, I usually fall back on utilitarianism using an exponential concept of suffering to try and resolve more ambiguous scenarios. While this still does not allow me to come up with an answer to every concievable moral issue, it is highly effective.
