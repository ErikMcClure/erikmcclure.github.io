I'm currently building a very simplistic first-person shooter in WebGL. An example of this algorithm, with the debug code left in, [is available here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/755994/s4game/s4game.htm). The map is represented by a grid - a cell is solid if its 0, and empty if its 1. This is trivial to render by using a standard recursive [4-direction flood fill algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill). Unfortunately, we can't simply render the entire level if our rooms contain high levels of detail or many objects, because we'll overload the GPU.

Frustum culling is the obvious answer, but I need it to be highly efficient. This means adjusting the frustum to account for corners, so I only render the visible portions of the level. While a lot of the speed concerns I currently have can be alleviated using batch rendering, this will stop working the instant I put in details that can't be batch rendered. Consequently, I want the algorithm to be as close to perfect as possible, only rendering rooms that are visible and no others.

This is where Tile-Based Discrete Wavefront Propagation comes in. The central idea is to represent the viewing frustum as a wave that flows through the level, getting split up when it hits corners. If properly implemented, this will be *exact*, only rendering rooms that are visible and no others. It turns out that you can implement this in {{<math>}}O(n){{</math>}} time, but we can't use the na√Øve recursive flood-fill anymore, because it's depth first. If we want to simulate a wave, we need to render the grid using a breadth-first search, to simulate it slowly spreading outward. Breadth first search is implemented using a queue by simply pushing all neighboring nodes on to the queue and rendering them until the queue is empty.

As the wave propagates through the level, we adjust the left and right angles of each individual wavefront according to the walls that we hit. This requires that we deal with two possible cases: the case where a wall is in front of the wave as it propagates through the level, and the case where it isn't. The only time the wave can actually be split up is when a wall is in front of it - the rest of the time, it is simply clipped on the sides. "Front" and "side" are defined based on what direction the wave came from. 

Starting with the case where there isn't a wall in front, we check to see if there is a wall on the right. If there is, we check the angles of it's corners. If either angle is inside the culling frustum, we change the right-angle to the one that is "farthest inside" (done in code by simply checking each angle one after the other). Then we do the same for the left wall, this time changing the left-angle, if appropriate. Then we send the updated angles to the neighboring tiles - the left one gets (left-angle,new-right-angle), the front gets (new-left-angle,new-right-angle), and the right gets (new-left-angle,right-angle).

If there *is* a wall in front, everything stays the same (note that the front wall has it's own set of corners you must check), but the angles that get sent through the neighboring tiles change. The left wall gets (left-angle,new-left-angle), the front doesn't exist so we ignore it, and the right wall gets (new-right-angle,right-angle). This effectively splits the wave down the middle, but it makes things complicated. Before, if a new left-angle was outside the culling frustum, we would just set it to the old left-angle. This doesn't work anymore, because we're splitting the wave, which means we require a new left-angle that isn't equal to the old left-angle. To solve this, if the new left-angle fails to exist, we set it to the old *right-angle* instead of the old left-angle, and vice-versa for the new right-angle.

Conceptually, this isn't too complicated, but the actual implementation gets complicated very fast due to angles being a giant pain in the ass to work with. We have to seed the initial queue with the neighboring tiles, and deal with getting proper frustum culling working, which is far more difficult than it seems. This will require a sizable number of utility functions, so we'll look at those first:

{{<pre javascript>}}function realmod(i,m) { i=(i%m); return i+((i<0)*m); } // Mathematically correct modulo
// Queue implementation using a circular array. Resize is very expensive, but almost never happens, because it remembers its size after each frame.
function Queue(sz) {
  this.array = new Array(!sz?1:sz);
  this.cur=-1;
  this.length=0;
  this.push = function() {
    for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
      if(this.length>=this.array.length) {
        this.resize(this.array.length*2);
      }
      this.cur=((this.cur+1)%this.array.length);
      this.array[this.cur] = arguments[i];
      this.length += 1;
    }
  }
  this.pop = function() { return this.get(--this.length); }
  this.peek = function() { return this.get(this.length-1); }
  this.get = function(i) { return this.array[this.modindex(i)]; }
  this.clear = function() { this.cur=-1; this.length=0; }
  this.resize = function(nsize) { 
    var sz=this.array.length;
    var c = this.cur+1;
    for(var i=sz-c; (i--)>0;) {
      this.array[c+nsize-sz+i]=this.array[c+i];
    }
  }
  this.modindex = function(i) { return realmod(this.cur-i,this.array.length); }
}
function realfmod(x,m) { return x - Math.floor(x/m)*m } // Implements mathematically correct fmod
// Gets absolute distance between two angles
function getAngleDist(u,v) { return Math.PI - Math.abs((Math.abs(u - v)%(Math.PI*2)) - Math.PI); } 
// Gets the signed distance between two angles
function getAngleDistSign(u,v) { return ((realfmod(v - u,Math.PI*2) + Math.PI)%(Math.PI*2)) - Math.PI; } 

  function getdx(dir) { dir=((dir+4)%4); return (dir==0)-(dir==2); }
  function getdy(dir) { dir=((dir+4)%4); return (dir==1)-(dir==3); }
  function exists(x,y,m,w) { var i = x + (y*w); return x>=0 && x<w && i<m.length && (m[i]&1)!=0; }
  function exists_dir(x,y,m,w,dir) { return exists(x+getdx(dir),y+getdy(dir),m,w); }

  // Gets the angle of a point from the player's origin (which is the camera's origin)
  var getangle = function(x,y) { return Math.atan2(y-player[0].elements[2],x-player[0].elements[0]); }
  // Gets the angle of a corner, offset from the given point by dir and diri.
  var getangle_dir = function(x,y,dir,diri) { return getangle(x+getdx(dir)*5 + getdx(diri)*5,y+getdy(dir)*5 + getdy(diri)*5); }
{{</pre>}}
First, the modulo operators in most programming languages are actually *remainder* operators. They do not perform mathematically correct modulo, and their behavior when you feed them negative numbers is not what you'd expect. The first thing we do, then, is define a modulo function that actually behaves like the modulo operator. We then use this to build a circular queue that resizes itself when necessary. When resizing, the queue must move all items to the right of the index over, which is a costly operation, so we let it keep it's size across frames. This makes the number of resize operations essentially zero.

The next few functions deal with angles. Angles are inherently circular, and this causes all sorts of problems. If our left-angle is 355&deg;, and our right angle is 5&deg;, the distance between these two angles is 10&deg;, not 350&deg;. There is a standard method to getting the absolute distance between two angles using the floating point modulo operator, which is implemented in {{<code>}}getAngleDist(){{</code>}}. This is all well and good, but we have defined *left* and *right* angles, which means we need to know if something is on the left hand side, or the right hand side. This requires a *signed* angular distance function, which makes things much more complicated because, once again, the floating point modulo operator *is not actually modulo*, it's a *remainder*.

So, we need to implement a proper floating point modulo operator. The standard fmod() function is implemented using the [following formula](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/fmod/):{{<bmath>}} \mathop{fmod}(n,d) = n- \mathop{trunc}\left(\frac{n}{d}\right) d{{</bmath>}}It's trivial to change this formula into one that gives us the correct behavior (remember, truncation is not flooring!):
{{<bmath>}} \mathop{fmod}(n,d) = n- \left\lfloor\frac{n}{d}\right\rfloor d{{</bmath>}}We can use this to define a function such that, as long as {{<math>}}b-a{{</math>}}, when forced into the range {{<math>}}\left[0,2\pi\right){{</math>}}, is less than {{<math>}}\pi{{</math>}} (or 180&deg;), we get a positive distance. If it goes past {{<math>}}\pi{{</math>}}, it becomes negative and heads back towards 0, just like in the absolute value distance function, but now with the proper sign. We will use this later to determine if a tile crosses over our angular culling frustum. {{<code>}}getdx(){{</code>}},{{<code>}}getdy(){{</code>}},{{<code>}}exists(){{</code>}}, and {{<code>}}exists_dir(){{</code>}} are all used to either bump x/y coordinates according to a direction, or determine if a specific tile exists. Now we get to the real function:

{{<pre javascript>}}var roomq = new Queue(10); // queue holding nodes
var drawmap = function(x,y,m,w,langle,rangle) { // map drawing function
  var i = x + (y*w);
  m[i]=(m[i]|2);
  // draw floor
     
  for(var j = 0; j < 4; ++j) { // Push initial neighbors on to the queue
    var nx=x+getdx(j);
    var ny=y+getdy(j);
    if(!exists(nx,ny,m,w)) { // If it doesn't exist, we ran off the edge of the map or hit a wall
      // draw wall
    } else {
      roomq.push(nx,ny,langle,rangle,j);
    }
  }
  
  var dir=0; // Stores the direction the wave is going. 0: (+) x-axis, 1: (+) y-axis, 2: (-) x-axis, 3: (-) y-axis
  while(roomq.length>0) {
    x = roomq.pop();
    y = roomq.pop();
    langle = roomq.pop();
    rangle = roomq.pop();
    dir = roomq.pop();

    var room=m[i];
    if((room&2)==2) continue; // If true, we already visited this node
    var mid = [langle,getAngleDistSign(langle,rangle)/2];
    if(mid[1]<0) continue; // If this is less than 0, langle has cross over rangle, so there's nothing to render.
    mid[0]=langle+mid[1];
    var angles=[getAngleDistSign(getangle(x*10+5,y*10+5),mid[0]),
                getAngleDistSign(getangle(x*10-5,y*10-5),mid[0]),

{{<div style="float:left;text-align:center;">}}<img src="/img/dwp_fig1.png"><br/>*Straddle Error*{{</div>}}First, we push our 4 neighboring tiles, provided they exist, on to the queue, seeding them with appropriate directions that radiate outward from our starting point. Then, we start running through the queue, and do an initial check to see if we already dealt with this tile. If not, we check to make sure that the left-angle is really less than the right-angle, and then go into standard frustum culling. In order to figure out if a tile is within our view, we need to ensure that the entire tile is either to the right or to the left of our angular viewing frustum. This means that all 4 corners must have angles outside of our frustum, and they must all be *on the same side*. If they are not on the same side, then the cone could have passed through the center.

This is what the first two if statements do. The problem is that a tile directly behind us will also be considered straddling the angular range, because our distance function wraps at 180&deg;. To solve this, we have a third if statement that throws away everything that is more than 90&deg; (or {{<math>}}\frac{\pi}{2}{{</math>}}) from the center of our frustum. This means the maximum horizontal field-of-view is 180&deg;. Note that this culling is independent of the algorithm, you'd be using this same logic if you were only doing simple frustum culling.

{{<div style="float:right;text-align:center;">}}<img src="/img/dwp_fig2.png"><br/>*Split Error*{{</div>}}If the tile survived the culling function, we mark it as visited. It's important that we only mark a node as visited *after we have decided to render it* because of a very nasty edge-case that can happen during the breadth-first traversal. It's possible for a tile that is rendered on one side of a split frustum to reach a visible tile on the other side of the split, and erronously mark it as invisible, using it's own frustum. The tile actually is visible, but only to the frustum on the other side of the split.

Then, we check the appropriate corners and assign {{<code>}}langle{{</code>}} and {{<code>}}rangle{{</code>}} appropriately. The neighbors are iterated and new values passed as needed. Once this phase of the algorithm is completed, we call {{<code>}}reversefill(){{</code>}}, starting on the same tile we called {{<code>}}drawmap(){{</code>}} with. This will use the standard fill algorithm to reset the "visited" marks on the map. By doing this, we avoid having to set all 2500 nodes of a 50x50 map to 0. The algorithm is now complete.

Because this algorithm runs in {{<math>}}O(n){{</math>}} time and is *exact*, it is asymptotically optimal. The problem is that it is only optimal in a single-threaded sense. The breadth-first iteration technique allows us to run each individual level concurrently, but this will only reduce the worst-case complexity from {{<math>}}O(mn){{</math>}} to {{<math>}}O(\max(m,n)){{</math>}}. 50 is a lot better than 2500, but this is only for a very, very large room. If we're dealing with a hallway, the concurrent performance would be identical to the single-threaded performance!

Consequently, while this is useful for tight corridors, the algorithm itself isn't really that useful outside of the game's narrow domain. Once the rooms start getting large enough, you're probably better off brute-forcing most of it and using approximations. However, the algorithm is *exact*, which is very important for calculating *Enemy Line-of-Sight*. So if you're dealing with a grid-based game and need to figure out if an enemy has a direct line of sight, this technique allows you to make a precise calculation, since it only hits tiles that are visible, and no others. This gives it an advantage over na√Øve raytracing, which requires many rays and is prone to giving false-negatives when dealing with narrow hallways.

Unfortunately, it still breaks when you try to make it work with FoV's greater than 180&deg;, so unless you split them up into 90&deg; chunks, it's pretty useless for things like lighting. I'm probably not the first to come up with the algorithm, either; someone probably invented this in their garage in 1982. Oh well.
