One could argue that your company has a serious problem if it has managed to garner a reputation for ruining any company or product it buys. In recent years, this is exactly what has happened to Microsoft. Whether or not it has actually been *ruining* its recent purchases is up for debate, but they certainly seem to have settled into a pattern of buying some popular product, then making changes that piss off the existing userbase. Ostensibly, these changes are intended to bring in new users at a short-term cost of pissing off some existing loyalists, which is not always a bad idea.

The argument here is often "some people just don't like change, no matter what it is." This is entirely true, but it seems that some executives get so used to this that they simply assume *any* opposition to *anything* new is simply because people hate change. They discard all negative responses with the assumption that people will get over it.

Except... people aren't getting over it. Recently, Microsoft has had to backtrack on many different changes, the most visible being the catastrophic Windows 8 start menu shenanigans. Skype's quality has devolved so far it is being abondoned *en masse* for alternatives like Discord or Telegram. Pissing off loyalists seems to be a chronic problem for Microsoft, as shown by their stunt last year with reducing the free storage in OneDrive to 5 GB. The only loyalists who seem to survive the onslaught of Microsoft's ineptitude are the ones that get lucky or the ones that are masochists.
