{{%blockquote%}}*"Are you certain you want to do this?"*{{%/blockquote%}}

14 years ago, a small group of students at DigiPen created a game called Genjox as part of their senior project. DigiPen had only just begun awarding diplomas to graduates of it's new R.T.I.S major, and was at the very beginning of it's meteoric rise in popularity. Each year, programming students were required to build basic game engines from scratch. They would team up with two or three other students to form a group capable of creating the art, level design, programming, and sound effects/music for each game.

Genjox was one such game. Developed by team "Tileware", it was a finalist in the 2001 IGFâ€™s Student Showcase. The premise is simple: it's a multiplayer battle arena where players fly around the map shooting various weapons at each other. You can play against devilishly difficult AI, or with friends (or both) across 9 different maps of varying sizes. At first glance, the game seems rather simplistic, but this belies deceptively clever weapon and map design, with all sorts of small details that can be used in interesting ways against your opponents.

The game was shown to me by a friend around late 2002. At the time, I was fascinated that a game made by a bunch of college students that still had debug console output could be so *fun*. I enjoyed many multiplayer battles with friends, often forming impromptu teams against the bots and laying claim to one of the health generators in a corner of the map as a sort of home base. Eventually, it was put away and forgotten. A few years later I took it out again and gave it another go. It was a nice shot of nostalgia for a game that seemed so simple on the surface, yet provided hours upon hours of entertainment.

A decade passed. Computers were replaced and hard drives were reformatted. Genjox was long gone from my system, but it never occurred to me to preserve it. Why would I? Anyone could download it off of DigiPen's website, for free. Then, last weekend, I had another moment of nostalgia. I navigated to DigiPen's website, hoping to download a piece of my childhood and give it another go.

**[It was gone.](http://games.digipen.edu/browse)**

This was somewhat surprising, since it seemed like DigiPen would have continued hosting an IGF finalist game like Genjox. It was a part of their history. They had games all the way back to 2004, but no earlier. All the older games had simply *vanished*.

Now, by itself, this is not cause for alarm. Surely the game would have been mirrored somewhere, right? All one had to do was use a bit of google-fu to dig it up. However, despite the game being mentioned in many different places, no actual mirrors of the setup existed. There were over 30 sites that posted "download" links for Genjox, and every single one of them redirected to DigiPen's webpage... which was now a 404 error.

I searched my hard drive in the vain hope that perhaps the game had survived in one of my backups over the years, but to no avail. In desperation, I asked my brother to check if he had the game, or if it had somehow made it on to our family server, but he couldn't find anything either. I also asked an old friend if he had a copy of the game lying around somewhere, but he was busy.

I began scouring the internet for any hint of the game, any residue it may have left. The Web Archive had a copy of it's old project page, but not of the setup itself. There apparently wasn't a single video of Genjox on the entire internet, or at least not one that Google could find. Even the images were simply the same ones that DigiPen itself had posted on the game's project page, all those years ago. I began to grow more and more distressed, convinced that I would never again be able to play a game that existed only as a faint memory.

Then, a miracle happened: My friend told me he had found a copy of the game on his hard drive! Overjoyed, I immediately uploaded the zip he sent me to three different hosting sites. It wasn't long before i'd organized a small multiplayer game over hamachi, and we were blowing ourselves up like it was 2001 all over again (you can watch the carnage [on youtube]()). The legacy of Genjox would live on, never to be lost again.

But what about the other games?

Genjox was not a magnum opus. It is clearly an unfinished product, full of rough and unpolished edges. However, it was still unique, a work of art forged with heart and passion. To lose a game like Genjox is like losing the last remaining copy of a painting, or the only known recording of a song. It becomes a fragment of our memory, only existing as a faint wisp of our consciousness. Digipen is still missing all of it's games older than 2004. I know Genjox wasn't the only game that made it into the IGF finalists, but they no longer live in Digipen's archives, and it is likely no one has archived them. A hundred years from now a digital archaeologist might still stumble upon Genjox, but they will know nothing of its siblings, lost forever to the sands of time.

Websites are slowly dying, and we haven't been able to archive all of them. What sites did we miss when attempting to archive Geocities? What old and forgotten tomes of programming will we lose when Google Code goes offline? The internet is only just becoming old enough to have a history of its own, and we must be careful about how we shepherd it, or we might lose something precious.
