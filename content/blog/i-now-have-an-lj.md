I'm not really sure why I made this, since the dA journal is perfectly fine, but journals on dA seem to work better for more artsy related stuff. On here I can spend pages and pages ranting about advanced programming concepts! Woo!

So, yesterday night I discovered that I am now [#1 on the CTG Music Charts](http://www.ctgmusic.com/charts.php). This, in turn, has made it highly likely that I will soon be [the most downloaded artist](http://www.ctgmusic.com/charts-artist.php?type=top_downloaded) on CTG Music. As of this writing I only require another 2446 downloads, so we'll see if I can keep my #1 spot.

So now I need to get off my ass, stop making profiles on sites (I made one on LinkedIn today too), and get back to work on my game, or I'll never finish it, and be locked into this hellhole of a life forever.

I need to start using an unregistered trademark on my company name...
