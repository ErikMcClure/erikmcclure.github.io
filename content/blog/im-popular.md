How do I know? Because [iZone](http://izone.newgrounds.com/) [stole 6 of my songs](http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/533184/22), without even bothering to rename them. It all started when a friend of mine pointed out that [someone had stolen](http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/293110) [Retarded Windows Song](http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/125976), which eventually led me to a guy [giving out his e-mail](http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/293112) so he can use [The Dark Temple](http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/124763) in his game.

That was the most fun I've ever had writing an e-mail.

I reported him, but not before taking [this screenshot](http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/9176/stolenownage.png).
