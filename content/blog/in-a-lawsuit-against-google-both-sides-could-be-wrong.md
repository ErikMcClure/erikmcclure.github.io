The [lawsuit against Google](https://www.scribd.com/document/368689407/Damore-vs-Google-Class-Action-Lawsuit#fullscreen&from_embed) is now available for public viewing, and while most of it is predictable nonsense, some of the evidence presented is very disturbing. Most people focus on the inherent absurdity of someone complaining that they are being oppressed because they want to oppress people. This is a level of mental gymnastics that is either breathtaking or horrifying. However, by riding this moral high horse into the sunset, they are glazing over some awfully concerning details:

 * "Not only was the numerical presence of women celebrated at Google solely due to their gender, but the presence of Caucasians and males was mocked with “boos” during company-wide weekly meetings."
 * one director promoted posts that advocated violence against Damore
 * an internal document explained how disagreeing with others about biases, racism and similar is "derailment", people disagreeing with the document were issued warnings and harassed
 * people not fully disagreeing with trump were harassed
 
I used to consider myself pretty far left, but what reasonable person thinks it's okay to *boo white males* and *encourage violence?* What can this possibly accomplish? Punching people might make them shut up, but it won't change their mind, and it definitely won't change their vote. I live in a world that claims to be diverse and inclusive, yet if I were to ever utter the words "James Damore has a point", I would probably get *death threats*. Luckily, James Damore is too stupid to have a point, but the evidence he is bringing to the table is still damning nonetheless. 

At some point, prioritizing "diversity" to the total exclusion of white males stops being "diversity" and simply becomes "anti white male". Google is still 56% white and 69% male, so it is comfortably white male dominated, but it seems to be careening towards a future where white males are actively discriminated against simply for being white males. I know it's hard to believe, but this is still racism and sexism. I don't think people understand how quickly the scales can turn when the social dynamic gets inverted, which is what appears to be happening. Firing someone because they express views that make others uncomfortable is a reasonable thing to do. Firing someone because they have views they do not push on anyone and does not impact their work simply because you don't like those views is dubious at best. 

It wouldn't even be that unusual. Liberals and conservatives brazenly discriminate against each other. People get fired because they voted for trump, or didn't vote for trump. Threats of violence are common. There was a news story today, a *news story*, that a [democrat and a republican](https://nypost.com/2018/01/09/democrat-republican-admit-their-bipartisan-love-affair/) were in a relationship. How could that be even remotely newsworthy unless our society has completely lost its mind? It's so bad that nobody can agree with *any single point* from the "other side" without being branded either a communist/liberal or a nazi/fascist. 

As an example, consider [Trump attempting to dismantle the H-1B visa program](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/visa-and-immigration/donald-trump-may-hold-back-plan-to-deport-thousands-of-h-1b-visa-holders/articleshow/62425288.cms). I don't know why he's doing it (probably because he's racist) but the H-1B visa program itself is deeply flawed and is in desperate need of reform. It's supposed to encourage hiring highly skilled foreign talent whose demands can't be met by the domestic work force. Instead, it's [abused to hire cheap foreign labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa#Criticisms_of_the_program) working for below average pay that's often grossly incompetent. Simply requiring the companies to pay anyone on the H-1B program a higher than average salary (based on location) for whatever job they're hiring for would ensure the companies are *actually* hiring skilled foreign workers they need and not simply importing cheap immigrants instead of paying domestic workers. 

Of course, I can't say any of that without being worried that some far left whacko is going to accuse me of being a xenophobic monster whose a conservative trump supporter, even though I hate Trump and his fanbase and don't agree with basically anything he's ever done, except this one thing he did for the wrong reason. There is no *nuance* in political discussion anymore. [It's gone full tribalism](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/439) - either you're with us, or you're against us. There is no middle-ground, because those that walk the middle-ground are simply seen as traitors to the cause. 

With that in mind, let us consider the possibility that *both sides are wrong*. James Damore is a racist asshole who is complaining about being oppressed because he wants to oppress people, and Google is apparently encouraging anti-white male sentiment to such a degree that its employees are *booing* statistics that show white males still dominate the company. *All of this* should be concerning to anyone who is still capable of rational thought.
