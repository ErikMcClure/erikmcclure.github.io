In the time since I first looked at a VB6 book, to now, I have heard a lot of things about programming. I have heard people say that programmers should never need to know what a pointer is. I have heard people say that there is never any reason to code in assembly. I've had someone tell me that coding in C++ is the worst mistake I will ever make, and that the only language you should ever use is C. Someone else told me that programming in C was for idiots and you can do anything you want in C#. I've seen other people say functional programming is more pure then anything else. I've had object-oriented concepts shoved down my throat since high school, and people constantly tell me that you should never use "protected" or friend functions, let alone have a function or variable outside of a class.

**These people are all wrong.**

A programming paradigm, just like a language, is a *tool*. You can't take a hammer out of your toolbox and expect it to efficiently cut down a tree. At the same time, you can't say the saw you invented to cut down the tree is going to be very good at nailing a board to the wall.

People who insist C exists only because of inertia are arguing that the hammer exists only because of inertia and that you should use a saw to nail your board to the wall instead. In a similar manner, people who insist that functional programming isn't good for anything in the real world are trying to cut down a tree with a hammer.

A paradigm is a tool. The next programmer who tells me I should do [x] instead of what I'm using for no reason other then what I'm using "sucks", "is outdated", "doesn't work" or any other totally nonspecific reason ***without ever looking at what I'm actually fucking doing with it*** is going to get a boot to the head.
