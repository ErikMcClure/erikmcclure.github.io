Shortly before the launch of Windows 10, I quit my job at Microsoft, because I knew what they were going to do. It didn't take long for the first updates to [start breaking things]() and for people to discover that Microsoft was going to suck up all your data [whether you like it or not](). They only cared about meeting deadlines, not shipping quality software.

Unfortunately, the alternatives aren't much better.

Google [does the exact same thing](), and has slowly but inexorably been moving away from it's short lived "Don't be evil" slogan. Facebook is [bending over backwards]() to accommodate the chinese government, which has so disgusted some employees [that they quit](). A friend of mine recently discovered that the small company he worked for had been bought out by Oracle, which is probably the closest you'll get to the ninth circle of hell. LinkedIn was [bought out by Microsoft](). Amazon continues to [generate horror stories](). 

It seems that getting a good job in software development requires you to leave your morals at the door. Some might argue that it's always been like this (Microsoft was far more evil in the 1990s), but I think that's irrelevant. The point is that **it shouldn't be like this**. It doesn't *have* to be. It doesn't matter if every industry on planet earth has always been like this. We're programmers. We are the future. I expect at least some of us to grow a spine and actually fight for a better future, instead of keeling over and giving in to the lure of Wall Street.

We were born in the Information Age, the dawn of computers, and it brought enormous productivity improvements to everyone. However, just as employee productivity has increased, wages have stayed stagnant, a harbinger of what's to come. We are headed towards the Robotics Age, which threatens to magnify wealth inequality by several orders of magnitude. As the heralds of this revolution, it is our responsibility, our duty, to shepherd its influence on humanity as positively as possible. It's not good enough to simply turn a blind eye to the increasing transgressions that we are making against humanity, to our own basic code of ethics, all in the name of progress. 

At some point, we must take responsibility for our actions.
