At the age of 12, I was asked who I'd be willing to die for.

I was told that it was okay if the answer was "nobody", because it was my choice. My decision to make, a decision no 12 year old should ever have to make. 

Our substitute teacher quit because she was too scared. She didn't know what to do during the drills. Where do you hide 25 children in a small classroom? There simply isn't anything you can do except huddle in a corner, trembling with fear and drenched in a cold sweat, waiting to die.

This is a fictional story based on a [real tumblr post](https://superhappybubbleslove.tumblr.com/post/183022724083/prismatic-bell-microcroft-historicalfawn "real tumblr post") by a 17-year-old teenage boy. I didn't have to worry about this when I was growing up. Our children shouldn't either.
