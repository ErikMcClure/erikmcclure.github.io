While most people seem to understand that our educational system is fundamentally broken, few realize that our attempts to improve the educational system are simply making it worse. The problem is twofold - we expect perfection from our students, and our tests are not testing what our students learned, but rather how good they are at memorization.

The fallacy of multiple choice tests is well known. Because they don't offer partial credit, they are terrible at testing anything other than rudimentary knowledge about facts. That is, they are only effective at testing what someone has memorized, not how well they understand a concept.

The problem is that this issue is not restricted to multiple choice tests.
