For the purposes of documentation, today (March 1, 2011), I went through and ensured that there were no competing products with the name "Black Sphere Studios". The closest match that was registered in the US trademark office was "BLACKBAUD SPHERE", which deals in non-profit management software. This company's name is sufficiently different from "Black Sphere Studios" such that there is no possible confusion between the two companies. A Google search for "Black Sphere Studios" turned up nothing but references to my own company, and a further search for simply "Black Sphere" turned up primarily metaphorical references and some domain squatting. There are no companies that could cause confusion.
