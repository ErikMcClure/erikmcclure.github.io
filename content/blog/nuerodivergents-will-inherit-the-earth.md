Decades ago, something absolutely unheard of happened - [a nerd became the richest person on the planet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1995/07/05/bill-gates-tops-forbess-list-of-worlds-richest/d6fa8522-2ccb-4635-b722-0b0b6b31bbd3/). This, of course, was merely a consequence of [Software Eating The World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/), a fact we are all now *painfully* aware of. Programming, once delegated to glasses-wearing nerds banging away on strange boxey devices that could add numbers, has been transformed into something that many people are interested in (mostly because it makes tons of money). Nowadays, as software permeates almost every aspect of modern life, programming is "cool", firmly entrenched alongside doctors and lawyers as a respected, high income career path, so long as you get hired at a large company (or at least, it's perceived that way).

If you think about it, this represents a radical societal restructuring. All these nerds being put in charge of things tend to be more progressive and willing to support social movements. Combined with the fact that the best programmers can come from anywhere, including diverse and underserved backgrounds, this has forced software companies to cater specifically to minorities, accelerating existing societal shifts simply because they want to attract good programmers. Adding benefits specifically designed for trans people is a common example, although there are many others. 

As our world changes, the kinds of people we need to support our society changes with it. I don't think people appreciate just how much the world has diverged from the neurotypical-cisgendered-heterosexual norms that were so entrenched just a hundred years ago. The United States only enshrined woman's suffrage with the [19th amendment in 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Ratification), just after World War I. It's not just that the social fabric of society has changed, *the world* has changed. The global reality we live in has changed. Climate Change is now an existential threat. Software and the digital world are not simply merging with physical reality, the internet now *dominates* it. [6 of the 10 largest companies](https://www.financecharts.com/screener/biggest) by market cap are software or hardware companies (7 including Tesla). The exceptions are Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway, and United Health. This is a **titanic shift** in economic power that's happened only in the past few decades.

This is not unique to modern history. Each major technological or geopolitical shift in human history changes the balance of power. World War II's [Rosie The Riveter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_the_Riveter) is the most recent example of a sudden geopolitical change (a global [Total War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_wars) necessitating a drastic social shift), when women were encouraged to take manufacturing jobs previously reserved for men. This was *extremely unusual* at the time, and after the war ended, the government abruptly started pressuring women to "return to normalcy". Sound familiar? While most women reluctantly returned to more traditional jobs, some historians argue it was the impetus for [The Quiet Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_workforce#The_Quiet_Revolution), which eventually resulted in women permanently entering the workforce. The [First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) and [Second Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution) notably involved a steep decline in infant mortality, but not child mortality, as the baby boom resulted in a massive increase in child labor that was much more deadly than the farm work they were doing before. This eventually resulted in much stricter child labor laws in the UK and United States, eliminating children from the pool of available physical labor.

Going back farther, ancient history is full of tribes and civilizations that displayed a huge amount of variation depending on their particular geographic and technologic pressures, including concepts of [alternative genders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender) or even [different ways of expressing time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronemics). A society is a particular subset of all possible personalities that are able to self-organize and maintain order. In any society, what exactly a "reasonable person" is and what constitutes a crime may vary widely. Factions within a society grow or shrink depending on economic and environmental influences, which can change the favored social fabric. This evolution of the social fabric is happening **right now** as technological advances allow entire forgotten sects of humanity to express their true potential in ways never before possible.

VR is still in an early adopter phase and its real impact has yet to be appreciated. We have only a scant few video games that can take meaningful advantage of it, a few poor attempts at metaverses, and zero useful productivity apps. We are teetering near another tipping point, where the entire world is utterly devoured by VR and AR in ways that people have difficulty appreciating because the hardware isn't quite there yet. Once the hardware is good enough to solve the last few critical problems - like comfortable reading without headaches - then everything will change, very suddenly.

I know at least 8 plural people. "Plural" people are people who are multiple distinct "entities" instead of a single being. Some of them are so good at programming it is difficult to describe what they even do - at least one is now a senior architect at a unicorn startup. Over half my friends have ADHD, and when hyperfocused are capable of things no neurotypical person could ever do. Many of them are autistic, capable of thinking in ways that neurotypicals cannot hope to touch without a lot of drugs. They don't just think outside the box, they think outside of boxes people *aren't aware of*.

In real life, this is sadly not always a useful skill. The real world is constrained by physics and euclidean space. Cities are often noisy. Nature can sometimes be an avalanche of sensory overload. These things are often suffocating to neurodivergent people, especially those on the autistic spectrum who have difficulty filtering out external stimuli. This is a pretty big problem in situations that demand being able to function in chaotic environments. However, it is completely absent in virtual spaces. A virtual world can exist in ways that reality could never possibly mimic. Non-euclidean physics are easy. Selective filtering of sound sources and conversations is trivial. Temporarily teleporting to your room to get away from a loud party is now just a click away. All the constraints are now completely different, and it is in this environment that neurodivergent people *thrive*.

Sadly, humans have a tendency to reject any culture other than their own as invalid or barbaric, possibly due to tribalism. Those of us living in a western country point to history as justification, while conveniently ignoring the fact that [history is written by the victors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_history#Philosophy_of_neutrality). Countries like America are often willfully ignorant of the natives they subjugated now [living in a post-apocalyptic world](https://twitter.com/indigenousxca/status/1282828465373233152). While many executives acknoledge the rise of LGBTQIA+ individuals, or at least pay lip-service to them, it is painfully obvious that most people do not understand the true cultural upheaval that is upon us. For example, [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/) is inherently doomed for a very simple reason: **It's not furry enough**.

Despite the prevalence of how [Furries Run The Internet](https://twitter.com/qDot/status/1539140148977233920), an amazing number of tech workers [still do not understand](https://web.archive.org/web/20200702214335/https://twitter.com/qualtrop/status/1278805133468545026) the significance of furries. Just two years ago, a coworker came out as both trans and a furry, in the same e-mail. I never saw the need to "come out" as a furry (which should be obvious) but the reality is that furries are now a significant social force, which is largely going ignored. The one significant competitor to [VRchat](https://hello.vrchat.com/) is [NeosVR](https://neos.com/), developed by... [furries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLD5swjr_28). A [starbucks union organizer](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4awzmm/fired-by-starbucks-union-organizer-now-wears-his-fursuit-to-rallies) wears his fursuit to rallies. The furry revolution is already here and nobody is paying attention to the fact that furries will not only *dominate* VR tech, they will determine the fate of any VR "metaverse", because **furries are the ultimate VR power users**.

This cultural blindspot is just one example of how humans are often *laughably bad* at predicting the future precisely because we are blind to social changes caused by technological advancements. This is why we laugh at [visions of the future from 100 years ago](https://www.ladbible.com/community/interesting-what-people-from-100-years-ago-thought-the-world-would-look-like-today-20210605), because they could only envision technological advances within the confines of their own culture. I still see people today predicting that VR will revolutionize painfully obvious things, like medical analysis, or 3D modeling, or architecture. No one talks about how it will provide a way for autistic people to be more confident about social gatherings when they control their sensory input sphere, or allowing plural people to switch between avatars depending on whose fronting. When people talk about "the dangers of VR", it's always [the same stupid reading argument](https://xkcd.com/1601/), instead of predicting the inevitable social upheaval after people realize "oh god, people are having *weird sex* in VR?!" It reminds me of the old adage about science fiction: 

> "It would take an inventor to predict the automobile, and it would take a real visionary to predict highways and gas stations. But it would take a science fiction writer to predict the traffic jam." - [Ed Bryant](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/10/23/traffic)
