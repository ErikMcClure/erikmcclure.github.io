Decades ago, something absolutely unheard of happened - [a nerd became the richest person on the planet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1995/07/05/bill-gates-tops-forbess-list-of-worlds-richest/d6fa8522-2ccb-4635-b722-0b0b6b31bbd3/). This, of course, was merely a consequence of the fact that Software Was Eating The World, as we are all now *painfully* familiar with. Programming, once delegated to glasses-wearing nerds banging away on strange boxey devices that could add numbers, was transformed into something that many people were interested in. Mostly because it was making tons of money. Nowadays, as software permeates almost every aspect of modern life, programming is in "cool" territory, or at least firmly entrenched alongside doctors and lawyers as a respected, high income career path, so long as you get hired at a large company. Whether or not this perception is actually true, of course, doesn't matter.

If you think about it, this represents an extremely significant societal restructuring. All these nerds being put in charge of things tend to be more progressive and willing to support social movements. Combined with the fact that the best programmers can come from anywhere, including diverse and underserved backgrounds, this has forced software companies to cater specifically to minorities, accelerating existing societal shifts simply because they want to attract good programmers. Adding benefits specifically designed for trans people is the archetypical example, although there are many others. 

As our world changes, the kinds of people we need to support our society changes with it. I don't think people appreciate just how much the world has diverged from the nuerotypical-cisgendered-heterosexual norms that were so entrenched just a hundred years ago. It's not just that the social fabric of society has changed, _the world_ has changed. The global reality we live in has changed. Climate Change is now an existential threat. Software and the digital world are not simply merging with physical reality, the internet now _dominates_ it. [7 of the 10 largest companies](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269857/most-profitable-companies-worldwide/) by marketshare are software or hardware companies (8 if you count Tesla). The exceptions are Berkshire Hathaway and a Saudi energy company. This is a *titanic shift* in economic power that's happened only in the past few decades.

The full effects of VR have not yet been appreciated. It is still in an early adopter phase, where the potential has not even been remotely realized. We only have a scant few video games that can take advantage of it meaningfully, a few poor attempts at metaverses, and zero productivity apps (because the resolution isn't there yet). We are teetering near another tipping point, where the entire world is utterly devoured by VR and AR in ways that people have difficulty appreciating because the hardware isn't quite there yet. Once we do reach the point where the hardware gets just good enough to make a few critical things possible - like comfortable reading without headaches - then suddenly everything will change.

I know at least 8 plural people. "Plural" people are people who have multiple distinct "entities" instead of a single person. They are so good at programming it is difficult to describe the things they are capable of. Over half my friends have ADHD, and when hyperfocused are capable of things no nuerotypical person could ever possibly do. These are people who are capable of thinking in ways that "normal" people cannot hope to touch without doing a lot of drugs (and not just adderall). They don't just think outside the box, they think outside of boxes people can't even *see*.

In real life, this is sadly not always a useful skill. The real world is constrained by physics and euclidean space. Cities are often noisy. Nature can be an avalanche of sensory overload. These things can often be suffocating to nuerodivergent people, espiecally those on the autistic spectrum who have difficulty filtering out external stimuli. This is a pretty big problem in real world situations that often demand being able to work in chaotic environments. However, it is completely absent in virtual spaces. A virtual world can exist in ways that reality could never possibly mimic. Non-euclidean physics are easy. Selective filtering of sound sources and conversations is trivial. Temporarily teleporting to your room to get away from a loud party is now just a click away. All the constraints are now completely different, and it is in this environment that Nuerodivergent people *thrive*.
