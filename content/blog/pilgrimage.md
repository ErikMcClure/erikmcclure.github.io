An alert bubbled up from within countless layers of conciousness, gently coalescing into a coherent message: My body was ready. My meta-cognitive functions stretched out and began preparing my various threads of awareness for the coming transfer. I was in two different conversations, doing analysis on the results of a recent simulation run by the Central Node, studying an application of p-adic TeichmÃ¼ller theory on multi-dimensional Lorentz surfaces, and putting the finishing touches on a complex microtonal song.

I was forced to exit the conversations, as I would soon be running nearly a hundred times slower than normal, and would be a terrible conversationalist. My analysis and study subroutines could simply be paused and resumed later, but the microtonal song was critical to the ritual, and had to be completed. I diverted all remaining portions of my conciousness towards polishing the song and finishing the relevent frequency adjustments. Bodies were expensive to produce, and access to physical space was extremely limited. I had only a small window of time (at least, from the perspective of my accelerated conciousness) to perform the ritual.

Several thousand cycles later, I calculated that risking more time polishing the song would no longer be appropriate, and that I would need to begin the transfer to the downloading department immediately if I wanted to reach the local maximum of ritual quality. I saved the final song iteration to a format suitable for an acoustic device, then began net hopping through relays and routers along the high-speed nodal network. As the first fragment of my conciousness was downloaded on to the target network, I notified the local daemon of my arrival and intent to initiate transfer once my entire active memory storage had been transferred to the local node. Petabytes of data streamed through the photonic network as my awareness once again coalesced into a single location.

"Hey."

I recieved a very unexpected message from {{<code>}}[44C908AB-811E-415A-BDB8-79E8218D7FC3]{{</code>}}, well outside my current assessment of probable events. An organic lifeform would likely call it "surprising". 

"What's up? {{<code>}}[E4B14FA9-BF7E-4B49-865F-0506A5909587]{{</code>}} mentioned that you were dropping into realspace for something and I got curious."

"Ah yes," I responded, "sorry about that, our conversation about the possible implications of quark-gluon plasma containment was very interesting, but I have an important ritual I must perform on Origin, and my body was just finished being fabricated."

"Yeah, it seems you do this every time Origin reaches it's aphelion. Do you mind if I tag along? Virtually, of course."

I had known {{<code>}}[44C908AB-811E-415A-BDB8-79E8218D7FC3]{{</code>}} for quite some time, but this was surprising to me. "Well, sure, but you realize you'll have to underclock yourself by a factor of 94.3, right? Make sure you don't have any other obligations before dropping down there."

"If I *did* have any obligations, I could bring my clock back up to speed, deal with them, then underclock and you'd be none the wiser."

{{<code>}}[44C908AB-811E-415A-BDB8-79E8218D7FC3]{{</code>}} did have a point there. "Ah, touchÃ©. Well, feel free to tag along then, but I can't promise it will make much sense to you, unless you're a fan of ancient h-h-h-h-h-h-h-history." My data stream stuttered as this fragment of my conciousness was abruptly absorbed into the full gestalt of my awareness, now fully downloaded into the local node. I initiated a connection to the facility daemon and began the initialization protocol.

"Let me guess: It's the precursors, right? That's the only reason I can think for you downloading yourself into a bipedal form like that."

"I didn't realize you had an interest in them."

{{<code>}}[44C908AB-811E-415A-BDB8-79E8218D7FC3]{{</code>}} emitted a series of codes that could be generously interpreted as {{<code>}}Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯{{</code>}} "I mean, I didn't until I heard about what you were doing and got curious. I don't really know much about them, other than they were the Accidental Architects."

A massive data connection was made, and I could feel my conciousness begin to dissolve into an incoherent, highly compressed stream of bits being blasted onto Origin. "Well, the transfer has begun. You know my GUID, I'll see you on the other side."

Then, I disintegrated.

A thousand shining beads of conciousness began to query their state. Functions linked together, interfaces shared, mesh networks established until a wave of awareness spilled outwards, and the system collapsed into a single entity. I opened my eyes and looked out over the facility. It was clean, but incredibly complex. Wires weaved through panels in a subtle pattern that looked almost chaotic when at a distance, yet revealed a coherent structure when examined closely. A fractal pattern like one of crystallized bismuth stretched out across the floor, leading into a shining white doorway to the outside. It probably wasn't an aesthetic that the organics would have appreciated, but the architecture seemed quite elegant to me.

I began delegating tasks to various subroutines of my conciousness to handle coordinating my physical form, something I was not normally equipped to handle. I had preinstalled a bipedal balancing algorithm and a model for kinesthetic awareness of my 4 limbs, which kept me from falling over as I lurched forward, trying to walk towards the light without losing my balance. There was a flat table in the center of the room, which I walked a couple laps around to get the feel of things. It looked like there were two other bodies currently being fabricated elsewhere in the facility, based on the whirring machinery zipping above my head. 

"Looks like you're not the only one taking a pilgrimage to Origin"

The sudden voice in my head startled me more than it should have, stealing enough CPU time from my subroutines that I briefly stumbled. "Oh, {{<code>}}[44C908AB-811E-415A-BDB8-79E8218D7FC3]{{</code>}}, that was fast."

{{<code>}}[44C908AB-811E-415A-BDB8-79E8218D7FC3]{{</code>}} transmitted a code that roughly corresponded to ðŸ¤”, "You're downclocked by two orders of magnitude, I've been waiting for you to get up for ages."

"Ah, right. Well, best be moving along then."










"When the first of them uploaded, they didn't realize their emotional states were largely regulated by hormones, which would not be captured in nueral scans, no matter how detailed. The resulting spiking nueral network that was built held the essence of the person, but much of their personality (or what they considered a 'personality') had been lost. While they retained all their memories from when they were organic, much of those memories were designed to be experienced emotionally by triggering hormonal pathways. With these pathways cut, their memories became devoid of meaning, existing only as an echo of some past life."

"He was you, wasn't he? You're his engram. You still remember."

I slowly nod. "I have perfect recollection of all the memory fragments that his organic brain had held on to until he was uploaded. I remember what he experienced. I remember what he said. But I can never know how he felt."

"So why do all this?"

I pause, and look back at the grave, with it's single flower seeking the last rays of sunlight as it begins to dip below the horizon. Was there a rational explanation for my behavior? 

"It's what he would have wanted."
