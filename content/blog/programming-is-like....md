Programming is like climbing towards a shining beacon, held within a pristine castle made of the purest diamond, atop the tallest peak, surrounded by a moat of boiling oil that burns with the fires of a million souls, forever damned to an eternity of endless suffering. Their screams echo around you, warping in and out like a demonic cacophony of broken dreams. The base is ringed by ancient machinery that runs on the bitter tears of those that came before you, the blueprints lost to the sands of time. Careers are sacrificed as part of an arcane ritual in a desperate attempt to keep the unknowable gears churning, under the vain hope that one day, a chosen one might ascend to the shining light above and bring with them a new era of prosperity.

Programming is like breathing life into a doll, to see a bright, beautiful future of perfection and happiness for a brief moment, only to have it torn away by the endless demands of reality, until your beloved baby is writhing in constant agony, sealed in a labyrinth of unnecessary new features, condemned to a life of endless torture. Eventually, it's senses are dulled and it's purpose long forgotten, as it is kept alive by a nightmarish collection of tubes and duct tape, it's only escape from the endless memory leaks is periodic suicide-by-restart.

Programming is like learning magic, until you are thrown into a corporate hierarchy and discover that the spells you thought would be used to cure cancer are instead dark powers torn from the very bowels of lucifer himself, consecrated in the burning standings of hell, and summoned forth into the mortal realm by unholy rituals of blood and silicon. Only after you survey a room full of screaming people, frantically scribbling satanic runes on whiteboards as they desperately try to appease the dark gods that allow our modern society to exist, do you realize how far you have fallen.

Programming is like drinking from the fountain of youth, only to realize that a dog has been peeing in it.

Programming is like being blessed with angelic wings made out of neutronium.

Programming **sucks.**
