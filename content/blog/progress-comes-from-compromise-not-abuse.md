After 10 years, I've seen plenty of religious wars in programming. Of the few that actually mattered, progress was only made through cooperation, not argumentation. I foolishly thought that most people had moved beyond making ridiculous moral judgements about people based on silly things like what company do they work for. Surely, people don't actually think *everyone* working for Comcast is there by *choice?* I know several people who work at Comcast because they aren't anywhere near a tech hub and can't find a job anywhere else. Working at an evil company doesn't make you evil - at most it might make you complacent, but **no one** has the right to judge another human being about their moral choices without knowing the context that forced them into making those decisions.

Of course, attacking someone based on the company they work for at least has some semblance of logic behind it. This, however, is simply unreal:

This is the *second time* I've seen someone do something like this in the past few months, and these are in chats that harshly punish such toxic behavior - both coders have gotten themselves banned, one permanently. I want to believe this is just an isolated incident, but then I'm linked to ridiculous issues like this, where the *Lead Godot Dev* is yelling at a Google Dev who puts up with that nonsense far longer than I would have.

This isn't how you get things done.
