{{%blockquote%}}*"We are what and where we are because we have first imagined it."* - Donald Curtis{{%/blockquote%}}

The wisdom of antiquity suggests that we must first imagine what we want to achieve if we are ever to succeed, but [science has other ideas](http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2011/06/08/visualize-success-if-you-want-to-fail/). A study demonstrated that visualizing yourself reaching a goal tricks your brain into thinking you actually did it, causing a relaxation response, which in turn robs you of ambition and energy.

This is a troubling counter-argument to age-old wisdom, but perhaps both sides can be right? I have been relentlessly pursuing the same goal for many years, and from my experience, it matters *what* you visualize just as much as *if*. In particular, one should imagine **what you are actually trying to create**, rather than what you would do with all your riches.

By coupling your imagination to your problem solving skills, you can draw a line between where you are now and what you need to do to make your vision come to life. This both solidifies your goals, highlights potential problem areas and outlines a clear plan of action, which helps [prevent procrastination](http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/07/10/the-procrastinating-caveman-what-human-evolution-teaches-us-about-why-we-put-off-work-and-how-to-stop/) caused by not knowing what to do. Simply imagining that we are living the high life after hitting the big time, however, merely drains us of ambition by creating a false sense of accomplishment. You must visualize your finished creation, not the act of finishing it.

There is a marvelous, unspeakably beautiful thing that wanders around in my subconscious. Every now and then I am given another glimpse, or shown another spark of inspiration of this indescribable *vision* that seems so real and yet could not possibly be written about, because nothing like it has ever existed. It's like looking into a future that could arrive tomorrow if only I could bring it to life. Sometimes I wonder if I'm losing my way, only for something else to trigger another magnificent concept. It shows me why I can never give up, even it if takes me an eternity to craft my thoughts into a new reality.

Your imagination is a tool, and like any other, it can be used or abused. Wield it wisely.
