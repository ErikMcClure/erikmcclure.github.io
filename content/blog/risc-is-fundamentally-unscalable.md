    Today, there was an announcement about a new RISC-V chip, which has got a lot of people excited. I wish I could also be excited, but to me, this is just a reminder that people still call ARM a "RISC" architecture despite ARMv8.3-A adding a FJCVTZS instruction, which is described as "Floating-point Javascript Convert to Signed fixed-point, rounding toward Zero"

The laws of physics ensure that no RISC architecture can scale under load.
