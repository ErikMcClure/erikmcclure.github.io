Many people consider AI to be the next technological revolution that will change everything, often in connection with the mythical "Technological Singularity" via super-intelligent AIs that exceed human intelligence. However, as many people have pointed out, we've [been here before](), only to fall into an [AI winter]() - [twice](). While I think this time is different (in that AI research won't hit a brick wall anytime soon), I don't think this will result in an intelligence explosion. The reality is likely to be much more mundane - complex neural networks will allow us to automate progressively more and more general tasks, but the overall complexity of tasks we can automate will increase very slowly - only as fast as our raw computational power increases.

What's interesting about this situation is that automating certain complex-yet-mundane tasks can trigger a technological revolution in society, even though AI research itself is just plodding along. When we talk about a "technological revolution", we're interested in inventions or technologies that *fundamentally alter how society works*, usually by *reducing costs*. A good example of this is computers, which drastically altered society by reducing the cost of making complex calculations. Then, along came the internet in the 90s, which revolutionized communication by drastically reducing the cost (both in time and money) of sending information over long distances. Then, in the 2000s, smartphones revolutionized how we used computers, reducing the cost of interacting with them by putting them in our pockets, allowing us to use them for everything from buying food to opening locks.

If we want to predict what technology might trigger a worldwide societal shift, we need to look at how it reduces costs, and on what scale. While AI research is unlikely to trigger a massive societal change by itself, modern AI research has helped create a new technology that could: **self-driving cars**. Many people don't seem to realize that transportation, like communication, is a fundamental bottleneck in how quickly a society can operate. [8% of America's GDP](https://www.selectusa.gov/logistics-and-transportation-industry-united-states) is spent on transportation and logistics, and over [3% of all jobs](https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm) in the United States are simply driving things from one place to another.
