title = "Software Engineering Is Bad, But It's Not That Bad"

+++
I've been writing code for over 12 years, and for a while now I've been pretty disgusted by the sorry state of programming. This is why I feel a deep kinship with Nikita Prokopov's article, [Software Disenchantment](http://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/ "Software Disenchantment"). It captures the intense feeling of frustration I have with the software industry as a whole and the inability of modern programmers to write anything even remotely resembling efficient systems.

Unfortunately, it's also mostly wrong.

While I wholeheartedly agree with what Nikita is saying, I am afraid that he doesn't seem to understand how modern computers work. This is unfortunate, because a misinformed article like this weakens both his position and my position and simply makes it more difficult to convince people that software bloat is a real problem.
