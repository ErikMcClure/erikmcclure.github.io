{{%blockquote%}}[Texas Board of Education cuts Thomas Jefferson out of its textbooks.](http://thinkprogress.org/2010/03/12/texas-education-board-cuts-thomas-jefferson-out-of-its-textbooks/)

The Texas Board of Education has been meeting this week to revise its social studies curriculum. During the past three days, “the board’s far-right faction wielded their power to shape lessons on the civil rights movement, the U.S. free enterprise system and hundreds of other topics”:

 – To avoid exposing students to “transvestites, transsexuals and who knows what else,” the Board struck the curriculum’s reference to “sex and gender as social constructs.”

 – The Board removed Thomas Jefferson from the Texas curriculum, “replacing him with religious right icon John Calvin.” 
 
 – The Board refused to require that “students learn that the Constitution prevents the U.S. government from promoting one religion over all others.” – The Board struck the word “democratic” from the description of the U.S. government, instead terming it a “constitutional republic.”{{%/blockquote%}}
 
So now the United States isn't a democratic nation anymore because someone *didn't like it*. I guess Texans aren't worthy of being called human beings anymore because *I don't like them*. I guess Fred Meyer shouldn't let conservatives into the store because they're a *public nuisance*. Why don't we just send all the kids into *fucking gas chambers* and speed up the process?! How about we just re-name America to *"The United States of Idiocy"*. If anyone so much as says *one word* in support of Texas, I will *BURN YOU ALIVE*. I have ***HAD IT*** with people amusingly demanding that I be more accepting of other political views.

Oh, ***I*** need to be more accepting of other political views. *SURE*. I have a better idea, why don't you all go *fuck yourselves* because **I don't care**. So far I have met about 150 people who have qualified themselves as decent human beings. About 40 of them *don't* have self-esteem issues.

Society is destroying the only human beings worthy of being called "human." People who are *sensible*. People who *listen* to opposing evidence. People who are actually attempting to do something useful. People who understand what is *important*, people who know that its our intelligence, our creativity, and our dreams that are worth fighting for. People who don't understand why anyone would consider them worthy of such praise without realizing that it is this very trait that puts them far above the average. It's people who know they have to *earn* their life.
