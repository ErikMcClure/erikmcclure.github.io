On September 23, 2065, at about 2 PM, a form was signed and an automated system deducted nearly half a billion dollars from one of Google's many bank accounts. Most people wouldn't realize the U.S. government had just handed over most of it's decision making to Google even after a joint announcement from Congress and the White House was made later that day. Most of the news outlets didn't even run a segment on the announcement, aside from some left-leaning conspiracy sites. 

Of course, most Americans were unaware that 90% of all news was owned by a single corporation, Time Warner News-Corp, after a series of acquisitions following the relaxation of anti-trust measures in 2053. The remaining 10% was largely dominated by Viacom, serving as "competition" that never seemed to step on anyone's toes. This was accomplished by deliberately maintaining contradictory news stations aimed at certain sects of the population. Advanced audience targeting was used to lure people to a specific "knowledge bubble", which then fed them news tailored to their preferences. Political divisiveness was manufactured on a daily basis between two segments of the population, usually the poor and the lower-middle-class. 





After the collapse of the Republican party in late 2030, the Libertarian party made huge inroads by mandating the automation of all government services. What they didn't mention is that this would be accomplished by contracting the automation out to a third party, essentially privatizing the government, just as the republicans had. The Tea Party, having survived the Republican Implosion of 2038, tended to side with the libertarians, who promised a smaller government thanks to automation. Thus, despite having fewer total members than the Democrats, the Libertarians were able to seize control of the house, and in the 2060 election, bolstered by a growing number of Tea Party voters, captured the presidency and both houses of Congress.
