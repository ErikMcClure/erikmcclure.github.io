According to various political opinion polls, I am supposedly all the way on the extreme left end of the political spectrum, a full-blown liberal progressive socialist who probably smokes weed and makes a living recording youtube videos about how I'm being oppressed by the white cismale patriarchy, or something. In reality, I *am* an upper-middle-class straight cisgender white male. I oppose censorship in all forms, including refusing to let people you don't like talk at your university, and have [highlighted the difference between free speech and harassment](). While I support LGTBQ, gender equality, economic equality, racial equality, religious equality, and basically anything else involving the word "equality", I absolutely refuse to be a white knight. We no longer live in a society where this is necessary. The internet has given everyone a voice, and the oppressed minorities are entirely capable of speaking for themselves.

Meanwhile, on the economy, I support a regulated market, but only to ensure that it *stays* a free market. As far as I can tell, most people who want to remove **all** regulations in the name of a free market either [don't understand what a perfectly free market is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition), or in some cases have forgotten [what happened when we tried that the first time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle). Regulations should exist to enforce the balance of power between consumers, employees, and companies, or they shouldn't exist. In many cases, after I question someone who has declared that they support a free market about what basic sanity regulations they would support, *we actually agree on most of them!* We never even disagreed about anything significant, it's just that the words "free market" have become so diluted they barely mean anything anymore.

This is a problem that has consumed all modern political discourse. I don't know of a single person, even if they disagree with gay marriage, who actually cares about that stupid [transgender bathroom thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathroom_bill). *Most people* don't care, just like most people [actually want universal healthcare](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-republicans-democrats-poll_us_55e5fbb8e4b0c818f6196a82) if the word "Obama" isn't anywhere near it. Most people want gender equality, but they keep hearing from militant feminists from Tumblr who think all men are rapists.

The rhetoric on both sides has gone completely insane. In comparison to what you hear on political talk shows, I'm barely center-left. Nobody is actually arguing about anything anymore. Instead, both sides say you shouldn't listen to the other side because they're wrong and bad and they'll brainwash you. We talk about how we shouldn't be giving air-time to whackos so they don't "corrupt" people with faulty logic, even though the internet will give them all the air time they want. Nobody is suggesting we simply *teach people how to think logically* and then dismantle all the crazy accusations **from both sides** using common sense, so we can return to debating the things we really disagree about.

We have created a reality that only exists in our minds, where everyone not on our side of the political aisle is a frothing psychopath who's impossible to reason with. This isn't true now, it wasn't true 50 years ago and it's not going to become true no matter how hyperpartisan our political climate becomes. We have reached a point where people will say things just for "liberal tears" or "conservative tears", even when these things are not accurate representations of their actual political views.

This is one of the crucial issues with the
