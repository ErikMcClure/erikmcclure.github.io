+++
Ever since 2013, I've consistently started getting registration e-mails in foreign languages from sites I definitely did not sign up on. At first, it was mostly just gaming sites from children who apparently did not understand what an e-mail address was. However, things slowly began to escalate.

One particularly frustrating issue was with Instagram, on which a bizarrely determined young boy from somewhere around Denmark was trying to register using my e-mail address. Instragram lets you remove an e-mail from an account, which is what I did, repeatedly, but the kid _kept adding the non-functional e-mail back on to the account_. Eventually I forced a password reset and forcibly deleted his account, in an attempt to dissuade him from using someone else's e-mail in the future. Astonishingly, this did not work, and I was forced to register on Instagram just to prevent my e-mail from being used.

This particular young boy shared a first name with me, and I noticed his name on a few of the other e-mails I had gotten as well. At first, I assumed he was the primary issue, somehow getting it into his head that my e-mail was his e-mail. I thought this might be related to the infamous [gmail dot issue](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en), but astoundingly, every single time I checked what the actual e-mail was set to, it was _mine_. No dots, no apparent typos, just... my e-mail. I was baffled, until I started getting even _weirder_ e-mails.

* Someone near Denmark used my e-mail to open an Apple ID. I went in to disable the account and it included _payment information_ and their _home address_, along with the ability to remotely disable their apple device.
* Someone signed up for Deezer in what seemed like Finland and actually had an _active subscription_. This one was particularly frustrating because Deezer had essentially permanently associated the e-mail with that account and there was no way to delete it or change the e-mail.
* Just recently, someone signed up for netflix, got the account temporarily suspended for lack of payment, and then added a payment option before I decided to go in and change the e-mail while also signing up for netflix so I wouldn't have to deal with that anymore. I could see part of the credit card payment option they had used.
* Another time, I woke up to someone in a european timezone creating an account on Animoto and then uploading 3 videos to it before I could reset the password and lock out the account.

What's really disturbing is discovering just how fragile many of these websites are. Most of them that allow you to change your e-mail address don't require the new e-mail to be verified, allowing me to simply change it to random nonsense and render the account permanently inaccessible. Others allow your account to function without any sort of e-mail verification whatsoever, or only nag you about verifying your e-mail without restricting your activities.

What I think is happening, in many cases, is that these people just assume they are picking a username that happens to have @gmail.com on the end of it. My e-mail is simply my first name and a number, and it probably isn't hard for someone also named Erik to accidentally land on the same number. However, some of these e-mails are for people clearly not named Erik, so where is the e-mail coming from? Why use it?

Given how fundamental e-mail is to our modern society, it's disconcerting that some people, especially young kids, have no idea how powerful an e-mail is. When they provide the wrong e-mail for a service, they are handing over the master keys to their account. These services use e-mail as a primary source of identification, and some of them don't even seem to realize they're using the wrong e-mail.

Still, the list of wrong e-mails I've gotten is pretty ridiculous. So far, I've had my e-mail used incorrectly to sign up for these services:
