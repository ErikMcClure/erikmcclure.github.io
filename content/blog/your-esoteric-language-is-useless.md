You'd think that programmers would get over these ridiculous language wars. The consensus should be that any one programmer is going to use whatever language they are most comfortable with that gets the job done most efficiently. If someone knows C/C++, C#, and Java, they're probably going to use C++ to write a console game. You can argue that language *[x]* is terrible because of *[x]*, but the problem is that *ALL* languages are terrible for one reason or another. Every aspect of a languages design is a series of trade-offs, and if you try to criticize a language that is useful in one context because it isn't useful in another, you are ignoring the entire concept of a trade-off. 

These arguments go on for hours upon hours, about what exactly is a trade-off and what languages arguably have stupid features and what makes someone a good programer and *blah blah blah blah **SHUT UP***. I don't care what language you used, if your program is shit, *your program is shit*. I don't care if you wrote it in Clojure or used MongoDB or used continuations and closures in whatever esoteric functional language happens to be popular right now. Your program *still sucks*. If someone else writes a better program in C without any elegant use of anything, and it works better than your program, *they're doing their job better than you*. 

I don't care if they aren't as good a programmer as you are, by whatever stupid, arbitrary standards you've invented to make yourself feel better, they're *still doing a better job than you*. I don't care if your haskell editor was written in haskell. Good for you. ***It sucks***. It is terribly designed. It's workflow is about as conducive as a blob of molasses on a mountain in January. I don't care if you are using a fantastic stack of professionally designed standard libraries instead of re-inventing the wheel. That guy over there re-invented the wheel the wrong way 10 times and *his program is better than yours* because it's designed with the *user* in mind instead of a bunch of stupid libraries. I don't care if you're using Mercurial over SVN or Git on Linux using Emacs with a bunch of extensions that make you super productive. *Your program still sucks*. 

I am sick and tired of people judging programmers on a bunch of rules that don't matter. Do you know functional programming? Do you know how to implement a LAMP stack? Obviously you don't use C++ or anything like that, do you? 

These programmers have *no goddamn idea what they're talking about*. But that isn't what concerns me. What concerns me is that programmers are so obsessed over what language is best or what tool is best or what library they should use when they should be more concerned about what their program actually *DOES*. They get so caught up in building whatever elegant crap they're trying to build they completely forget what the end user experience is, especially when the end user has never used the program before. Just as you are not a slave to your tools, your program is not enslaved to your libraries. 

Your program's design should serve the user, not a bunch of data structures.
