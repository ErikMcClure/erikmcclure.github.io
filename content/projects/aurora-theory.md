4 years in the making, Aurora Theory is a compilation of all the songs I managed to make while attending university. The earlier songs were extensively improved, and all songs were remastered for the album's release.

Buy it on [Bandcamp](http://erikmcclure.bandcamp.com/album/aurora-theory) for $7, or $10 on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/id672763525), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DVS2EDO/), and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Erik_McClure_Aurora_Theory?id=Bcsjkg4chdqymqrpsxagjxvkm2i). The album is also available on Spotify, last.fm, other online radios, and can be previewed on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD5zdsIOkqQ&list=PLo4BIkE52kLTO0Hh9ROqJUXy9OdtT5-rT).
