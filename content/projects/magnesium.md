A highly modular game engine built around a Entity Component System, using ordered systems and optimized component arrays. Comes with built-in support for [PlaneShader](https://github.com/ErikMcClure/planeshader), Box2D, [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/), and [TinyOAL](https://github.com/ErikMcClure/tinyoal), but can easily be extended to unify any set of technologies needed.
