A highly modular game engine built around a Entity Component System, using ordered systems and optimized component arrays. Comes with built-in support for [PlaneShader](https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/planeshader), [Box2D](https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/Box2D), [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/), and [TinyOAL](https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/tinyoal), but can easily be extended to unify any set of technologies needed.
