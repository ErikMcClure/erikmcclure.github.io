An adaptive, hybrid 2D graphics engine with automatic batch rendering. Currently only supports DirectX on Windows, but can be extended to different graphics APIs and platforms in the future. Allows 2D games to integrate simple 3D effects, and allows implementing a fully gamma-correct 2D lighting pipeline.
