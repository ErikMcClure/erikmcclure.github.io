An anti-spam bot for Discord used by over 1000 servers spanning nearly a quarter of a million users. Primarily designed to detect and neutralize raids or trolling attempts, and to augment discord's existing moderation tools. Many users joining at the same time will trigger a lockdown to help immunize the chat against raids. Patreon supporters also have access to a chat log that allows moderators to track deleted messages.
