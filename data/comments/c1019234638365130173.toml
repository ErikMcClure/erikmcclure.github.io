content = "&quot;<i>If that is your definition of determinism</i>&quot;? Come on, it is a normal English word with a clear-cut definition. It is not like I&#39;m making up words here. It&#39;s also really important for games (not all type of games though), so I thought you would be fairly familiar with the term.<br /><br />My extrapolation does not invalidate the physics state. Assuming the update-thread runs at 60 FPS then at worst case the extrapolation will account for max. 16.6 ms of movement (and  ~8.3 ms on average). This extrapolation is only used for rendering and not for modifying the physics state. If something goes through a wall because of extrapolation then at the next update frame it will already have been set to the right coordinates.<br /><br />You keep pointing out problems where there are none, yet you continue to insist that there are. The comments you make, like the one on invalidating a physics state, makes me doubt you have actually read it. I get the impression that you just have glanced over it and thought that it&#39;s just some overly complicated jibberish. I don&#39;t mind if you don&#39;t want to read it, but please don&#39;t come up with obviously wrong &#39;problems&#39; that my engine has.<br /><br />If you make all calculation depend on the previous frame and gather input at start of the frame, then you&#39;re missing one important step. The physics should run at a fixed steps per second, shall we say 60FPS? Now imagine, if you will, your game being rendered on a 120 Hertz monitor. If you decide to render at 120 FPS you&#39;re only rendering 60 new frames per second. Any discrepancy between update-FPS and render-FPS will lead to nasty side effects! Simply increasing how many times you update per second won&#39;t help you that much. For your engine it is really weird to fix the update-thread to a certain FPS, as they are just &#39;jobs added to the queue&#39;.<br /><br />The best thing you said is &quot;<i>I have absolutely no idea how ensuring that your engine was deterministic had any effect on your engine design.</i>&quot;. Maybe this is the reason why I have such a difficult time explaining to you how determinism should be enforced. On the other hand you say &quot;<i>every single solution I have ever built for this [...] will be deterministic</i>&quot;, another obviously wrong statement. If you render your game at 1000 FPS how often you call your physics library? 1000 per second times right? You want to update the positions 1000 times otherwise rendering with such a high speed has no real benefit. Calculating physics with a time step determined by rendering speed will break determinism. <a href=\"http://box2d.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=8585\" rel=\"nofollow\">Box 2D physics are only deterministic of the timestep is constant.</a>.<br /><br />Civilization 5 is a turn based game which simplifies creating network-protocols and replay-files, so there is no real added benefit for adding determinism in such a game. This is why I stated previously that the engine for Civilization 5 has it very easy. An RTS has way more hurdles to overcome so I&#39;m more impressed with the engine used in Supreme Commander 2 and Starcraft 2, even if they don&#39;t look as beautiful. It is ignorant to think that CIV&#39;s approach is a one-solution-fits-all, which is exactly why I&#39;ve posted the links on a deterministic non-blocking render loop.<br /><br />If you&#39;d like, I can come up with some resources that explain what determinism is, why it is important for (certain type of) games, why it is difficult to have determinism without fixing render-FPS and how determinism helps in simplifying network protocols for games (among other things).<br /><br />Do you now understand why your game engine is not able to be deterministic without severe consequences?<br /><br />Thanks for the link on CIV5&#39;s engine presentation. I really wish I was there to hear about the details :) Looking at those sheets really makes me want to continue experimenting with game engine techniques."
