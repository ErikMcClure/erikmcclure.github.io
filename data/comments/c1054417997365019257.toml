content = '''Good point. I did start recently looking at the graphics side of programming again. I enjoy it so much more than the web-apps I do at work, but that&#39;s what pays, not to mention school keeps me busy as well. <br /><br />However, I was proud just to get a little C# app going that would render 3D points using basic 3D projection formulas, haha! Going to try to learn about rasterization and drawing in the triangles next- getting them drawn so they don&#39;t overlap seems like a hard problem to me. Have been looking up some articles but if you know of any specific good ones I&#39;d be glad to check them out. :P'''
