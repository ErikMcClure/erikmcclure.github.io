content = "You are not alone, even if I haven&#39;t made those big tools like yours, but everything time I do something twice and I feel something suck I have to find a way to do it better. This drags me so far away from the first purpose which is making thing work. But more and more I realize, we are not alone. There are people out there which have the same ideas, I think you can make a demo of one of your work, people will follow. You will have true help. Just make a demo and push your stuff to github :) <br /><br />Same of you, music is a part of my life. I cannot live without it. <br />I hope you will use your time better with teamate, enjoying life and creating your beloved tool :)"
