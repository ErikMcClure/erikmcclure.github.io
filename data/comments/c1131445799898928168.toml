content = "Erik,<br />  An ability to identify and denounce the fundamental flaws of a system is a good thing to have. More specifically, your identification of math as the &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot; is very insightful. But, in the spirit of pointing out holes that need filling:<br />First, your tagline &quot;the greatest threat to our species...&quot; seems like an effort to aggrandize the problem you&#39;re interested in so that nothing less than the future of humanity rests on your shoulders. The assertion that the educational system is the reason why we can&#39;t make progress around problems such as global warming is a flight of fancy that can&#39;t be backed by evidence.<br />Second, you don&#39;t acknowledge the existence of entire fields of knowledge about a) the problems inherent to the educational system b) methods of teaching, in general or for math in particular. There are a few people who have been dedicating their life&#39;s work to the latter right under your nose in Miller Hall on the main quad. This is not to say that your thinking about how to teach math concepts is not a valuable exercise, or that you don&#39;t have anything to contribute to the field, but talking as if you are the first person to have observed the problems you identify is rather presumptuous. Hard problems are not meant to be studied in a vacuum; the loneliness of feeling like the only one who &quot;gets it&quot; is an indication that you&#39;re doing something wrong."
