content = "The little tiny drivers in earbuds tend to need less power as we get better at making them.  On the same volume settings, you&#39;ll usually get more noise from high-priced buds from the same year.  When this starts to become a problem, device-makers will adjust to it.  It wasn&#39;t a problem seven years ago and it&#39;s not quiiiiite a problem yet, but soon.
