content = '''There are plenty of claims and accusations here, but not a single one is backed up with even the slightest bit of  evidence. Your whole point was that Google has sold its soul to &quot;maximize profits,&quot; but didn&#39;t give a single example of how they&#39;re doing that...<br /><br />Saying that Google &quot;has succumbed to maximizing stock price for a bunch of rich wall street investors&quot; is absurd. Larry and Sergey together hold a majority of Google&#39;s voting rights. They&#39;re accountable to themselves, not wall street. If they were, they definitely wouldn&#39;t be sitting on $60 billion in cash instead of returning it to shareholders.<br /><br />To say that Google started based on ideals, is frankly a little naive. The 20% time rule wasn&#39;t established because they wanted push the boundaries of innovation, or any other noble reason. They were a internet start-up that just lived through a huge tech bubble blow up and were looking to diversify their product line. I&#39;ll concede that they were less interested in turning a profit early on, but that&#39;s goes for practically any start up in the last 15 years. Build something awesome, get a bunch of people to use it, then figure out how to make money later. Were you this upset when you realized Facebook wasn&#39;t just in it to let college kids stalk each other online? Google wasn&#39;t started to fix the internet, it just happened that making it more accessible at a time when it was still new to most people was a great business plan...'''
