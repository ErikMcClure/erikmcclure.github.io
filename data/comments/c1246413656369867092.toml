content = "Easy, the answer is no, we still use shitty Microsoft products that the whole world uses because people are idiots who don&#39;t care about ethics. Simple minds fall for marketing and their &quot;convenience&quot; takes over their minds and makes them spend more money on the dumbest of things. Idiots spend that money and enthusiasts get fucked over because again, they spend that money, shitty software makes it out of Beta, almost unfinished and everyone is at the very least &quot;satisfied&quot;, never happy. People say they&#39;re happy but I think that&#39;s an over-exaggeration of what those idiots *really* feel.<br /><br />How do I know? I&#39;m one of these idiots, except I run Ubuntu and I just want my goddamned programs to work. I know nothing about programming and I don&#39;t care to, I just like better software and better software would require ethics, but it *needs* to get done, unfortunately it&#39;s either one or the other.<br /><br />Getting it done: It&#39;s out, but has questionable stuff going on with it.<br /><br />Ethical software, or rather, Free Software: Almost never gets done, people want it fast, there&#39;s no hype, nobody uses it,<br /><br />&quot;Hey, we&#39;re making a Skype replacement but nobody knows about it, but it&#39;s still in alpha. Not enough man power, not many people want to contribute to bugfixing or bugfinding.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Nobody uses that yet though.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;... Yeah, use Skype *for now* (forever).&quot;<br /><br />I try to care about ethics and better software, but when I&#39;m the only, *only* one out of 100 million people in the USA who gives a shit about ethics in software, what&#39;s the goddamned point? All I can do is bitch and throw fits about everything and ask people about what they&#39;d rather do.<br /><br />&quot;Hey, wanna help test out some really cool software?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nah, I&#39;m good, I&#39;m texting my friend on Facebook with my iPhone.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Did you know Facebook tracks you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yeah, but I dn&#39;t caer, I can tak and txt to my frends on my rly cool i-pone&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Did you know Google shoves ads down your throat?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;im bying smething i fond on amzn lol&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Did you find a new iPhone?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;wahts an ipohne?&quot;"
