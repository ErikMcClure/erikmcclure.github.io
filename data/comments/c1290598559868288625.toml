content = "Overall: great post, and I agree with you on most points.<br /><br />That said, you are way, way too dismissive of global warming and space travel as serious issues. Yes, you can make the argument that education is a blocker on these issues because without educated individuals we can&#39;t solve global warming or space travel. However, you can make the exact same argument about, e.g, campaign finance reform, without which it&#39;s highly unlikely that we can reform our educational system. You can even make the same argument in the opposite way by saying that if we don&#39;t solve global warming we won&#39;t be around long enough to solve the education problem. I think it is unreasonable to claim that any one of those four issues is the most important, and that&#39;s not even bringing into consideration other issues like nuclear proliferation, structural employment decline due to automation, etc, etc.<br /><br />Is education a hugely important issue? Yes, absolutely. Is it the greatest challenge our species has ever faced? Probably not, and your hyperbole there is likely to cost you potential allies."
