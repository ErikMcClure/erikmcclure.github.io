Your point about physics reminded me of what might eventually be recognized as another limitation in current rendering technology: the physics of photons themselves, such as interference patterns.  Modeling the optical behaviors of, say a several-micron-thick oil sheen on a puddle isn&#39;t just about statistical reflecting properties of surfaces, it&#39;s also about the colors produced when the photons reflected from the surface itself interfere positively and negatively with those reflected from the oil/water interface producing vivid color.  And I think this is not just a &quot;photo-realism&quot; nit, but a whole different aspect of the physics of light that might become important with simulations and machine sensing."
