content = "Calm down. Your life is just beginning.  Things have a way of working out.  You remind me of myself pre-medication (for OCD, anxiety, and &quot;incipient bipolar disorder&quot;).<br /><br />Being gifted with a mind that is curious, capable, and restless can sometimes feel like a curse -- and in some ways it is.  You will probably never be able to function exactly like a &quot;normal&quot; person.  Your friends will forever say &quot;There goes Erik off the deep end again!&quot; and grin at each other, while drinking a beer, and flipping burgers with their kids on Saturday, knowing they go back to the chain gang Monday.  And you will wonder, how can these people be like this?  How can they just go to work, come home, have nice sex, produce babies, grow up, etc. and so on?  DON&#39;T THEY SEE WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING HERE?<br /><br />Well, they won&#39;t see it, unless you show it to them.  That is your purpose in life.  You are the creative.  But you have to get over yourself -- over the grandiose dreams of perfection, in form as well as substance.  For someone like you, the perfect is the enemy of the good, or even the great.  What you need to do is learn to RELEASE.  Release code, music, art, blog posts (you can do that apparently!)  Let them fly free into the aether.  Most of them will just float away, have no impact, never to be seen again.<br /><br />But that&#39;s OK. You can improve on the idea, polish the next idea, and do it again.  With a little luck, eventually, one or two of these things will somehow float back to you.  They will generate some interest, develop a fan club.  That can be 3 people, or 10 million.  You never know.  But you have to produce, and you have to release.  That is what you are evolved for, that is your destiny.  Accept and embrace it.  Stop worrying about everything that can go wrong, or how great you think someone else&#39;s output is.  That&#39;s like looking at a photoshopped picture of a  movie star and getting all cramped about your abs.  It&#39;s a fool&#39;s game.  You are you; the rock stars you may idolize are just humans too, and they went through this at some point.  The only difference is, they came through on the other side by letting go at some point, and allowing reality to take over.<br /><br />I hope this makes sense.  Good luck"
