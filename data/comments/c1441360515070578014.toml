content = '''Same old dribble that you always hear:<br /><br />&quot;A female US president would be horrible. She&#39;d care more about throwing socials than meeting with her Cabinet.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Women shouldn&#39;t go into corporate business since they can&#39;t be assertive without getting overly emotional.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Men who are vegan/vegetarian are pussies. No self respecting, red blooded man would pass up a thick, juicy steak.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He&#39;s a stay at home dad? Geez, he&#39;s probably submissive in the bedroom too!&quot;<br /><br />All of these are actual quotes from around the blogosphere that I&#39;ve seen. All of them are bigoted, all of them are sexist, and all of them work soley off of stereotypes. (In very poor taste, I might add.)<br /><br />Tis better to ignore people like this. Let them have fun shouting at the wall.<br /><br />-tarnishedsophia.wordpress.com'''
