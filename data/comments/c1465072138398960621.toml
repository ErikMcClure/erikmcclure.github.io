content = '''Dogma in anything leads to mediocrity at best and, let&#39;s face it, there&#39;s plenty of mediocrity in the industry. On the other hand there are plenty of people developing exciting and new open source projects all the time. Some do brand new things and others compete with existing projects.<br /><br />For front end web-dev&#39;s there are quite a few competing frameworks and libraries to choose from.<br /><br />New programming languages like Rust are being developed. A time consuming and expensive undertaking with plenty of other perfectly fine languages that have been serving developers for a long time.<br /><br />I&#39;d hope that your beef isn&#39;t with the leverage we all enjoy by participating in open source. Rather, I hope that it is with the uninformed and unimaginative who&#39;d prefer to use a nail where a screw was needed because it was handy.<br />'''
