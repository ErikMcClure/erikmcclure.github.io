content = '''Erik, thank you for this topic. I find it useful.<br />At least we could correct the school system by some in-family activity...<br /><br />But I should note that it is not so funny to find coarse words as &quot;bul...it&quot; in the topic related to math and to kids. Is it common in your country? (Some comments use even more ugly words...) :((((('''
