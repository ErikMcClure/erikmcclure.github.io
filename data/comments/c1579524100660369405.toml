I was frustrated because I saw lots and lots and lots of problems with everything, but school served only to get in my way. I wanted to learn [x] and had to wade through immense amounts of crap to get at it, which is why I eventually became adept at finding precisely what I needed through my own research.<br /><br />I have been putting a lot of stuff into life. I have several projects i&#39;m currently working on, the most advanced of which is a generalized n-dimensional trajectory optimizer using a beam search algorithm. College mostly just got in the way."
