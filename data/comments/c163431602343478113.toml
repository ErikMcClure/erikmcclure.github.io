content = "I really don&#39;t have time to write a proper rebuttal (since you know, programmers actually need to work), but in my line of work, one month I&#39;m writing an embedded network stack for a legacy protocol, the next month I&#39;m doing deferred rendering in our OpenGL engine, the next month I&#39;m writing a Qt tool to allow live modification of assets in our engine, the next month I&#39;m writing an observer/notification framework to handle state, the next month I&#39;m doing a device driver etc.  Really good programmers work on a diverse range of products / solutions, and using their vast experience hammer away at the problem at hand.<br /><br />If as a programmer you work in a single domain, then you really don&#39;t have the experience needed to grow professionally.<br /><br />PS - I work in a startup (games for custom built embedded systems), so I have to tackle a lot of unrelated domains in order to get stuff out."
