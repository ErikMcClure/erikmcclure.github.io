content = '''I am a 53 year old math/science nerd who 12 months ago decided to close my successful technology consulting firm (over $150k) to teach public middle school science in a school with the majority of children on free/reduced lunch (under $40k)  I have complained bitterly about public education for decades and finally decided to try and do something about it.  I recently completed my first year of teaching 8th grade science and was awarded &quot;teacher of the year&quot; by the school.  Here are some of my thoughts and ideas on our deeply flawed public education system.<br /><br />Rigor. Expectations on students are much, much too low. State standards are a complete joke - you can easily teach everything required in the standards in 2-3 months.  The only equation you are required to learn in all three years of middle school science is: Distance = Speed X Time.  Obscenely low learning targets start in elementary school where the entire school culture is based upon things being &quot;cute&quot;.  The only challenging courses in K-12 education are AP courses.  A child with an average IQ and bare minimal effort can NEVER do homework and easily pass the required state exit exams and graduate with a decent GPA - just avoid AP classes and public school is a cakewalk.  In my school no homework is assigned.  I asked why... The answer, &quot;kids will not turn it in, our parents don&#39;t care.&quot;<br /><br />Teachers.  Over 90% of middle school science teachers do not have a degree in science.  To be a poor teacher is incredibly easy - almost no effort is required.  To be a great teacher will sap every ounce of energy, ambition, talent and free time you possess.  Your principal will judge you on only three things - your ability to &quot;manage&quot; the classroom (keep kids sitting quietly in desks doing mindless busy work) your ability to do all the non-teaching tasks (help monitor the halls, turn in grades on time, etc.) and the percentage of students who pass the ridiculously easy state assessment.   <br /><br />Society.  Those who can - do.  Those who can&#39;t - teach. When I told my friends / peers / family members that I was quitting my business to teach middle school science they immediately assumed I had lost my mind.  Several seriously contemplated an &quot;intervention&quot; on my behalf.  Our society does not look favorably upon public educators.  A huge percentage of our populace considers the great majority of government spending a complete waste of funds.  &quot;We have dumped billions of tax dollars into education and our schools are still broken - why give them more?&quot; <br /><br />Pay. Your pay as an educator depends on only two things - years of teaching experience and your total number or college credit hours earned.  Horrible teachers get paid the same as the best teachers.  All teachers (except successful football coaches) are paid poorly.  Gifted and credentialed math / science teachers who work 70 hour weeks get paid less than the person who drives your garbage truck or city bus and has no college degree.  We will never have more than a handful of truly excellent educators until we pay them a decent wage based upon performance not seniority.<br /><br />Teachers Unions. Bad teachers NEVER get fired unless they commit a serious crime. Over 50% of educators do not belong in front of students but can&#39;t be fired because of unions.  Unions help teachers negotiate pay raises = good.  Unions protect bad teachers from getting fired and fight merit based pay systems = criminal.<br /><br />'''
