content = "After reading your blog,  I feel a little guilty for talking my daughter out of becoming a teacher.  The reason I did was precisely because of the reasons you stated for hating teaching and, specifically, recognizing that you can&#39;t change the system.  Being a teacher is tantamount to working for the Federal Government.  I know my daughter has no idea what that would be like.  Having worked for a large corporation for several years, I have some idea.  Knowing my daughter, she would hate that aspect of it.  Who would like it?  I&#39;d be interested to hear any comments you might have on Common Core."
