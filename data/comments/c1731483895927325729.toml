content = "Aaron&#39;s story is extremely sad.  I remember reading the articles on him and doing my own digging into his past the day his suicide came up.  More frustrating than being held back from changing the world I think is actually finding the freedom to change the world, only to discover just how little there is out there.<br /><br />I hope you manage to hold onto your ideals once you&#39;re free from your firm.  It will be a whole other game after that, which for me at least only became an evermore uphill climb.  I was of the mindset of wanting to help the world around me 3 years ago(wanting to help the world), at one point even scheming for what was essentially a utopia.  The hard part was not actually figuring out how to build it.  It&#39;s more the fact just how few people give a damn.  There are a lot of people who simply don&#39;t want to be helped, can&#39;t see the bigger picture and would rather shoot it down, or would just rather sulk in misery no matter how much you try to make it easier for them.  Things like leading a horse to water but not being able to make it drink totally apply there.  Needless to say, I&#39;ve long lost my patience and decided to forge my own path for better or worse.  I still care about these things, but freedom (financially and legally) imo is probably the least of your obstacles here, sorry to say."
