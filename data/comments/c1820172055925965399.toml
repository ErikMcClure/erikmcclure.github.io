content = '''Real antialiasing requires you to either calculate precise coverage over a given pixel for shadows, or sample the pixel a couple hundred times. This is obviously not actually *required* for the vast majority of antialiasing, which is why perceptual algorithms usually do the job. It becomes important for things like the sun shining through dense forest foliage - extremely tiny holes can let through a significant amount of light, and those holes are often MUCH smaller than a single pixel, which breaks a lot of our antialiasing algorithms.'''
