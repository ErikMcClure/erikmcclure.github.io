content = "The thing with LA Noire is still scripted. The facial expressions were recorded by the actor by multiple high resolution cameras at multiple angles. The amount of effort that went into it was pretty cool.<br /><br />Still, it&#39;s scripted. Basically, if scene A happens, play &quot;Annoyed&quot; sequence, if Scene B happens, play &quot;surprised&quot;, etc.<br /><br />Currently, we can take hi-res 3D scanned objects and put them into games, provided you aren&#39;t scanning in cloth. Scan a cup, car, object, food, all doable objects, but once you introduce dynamic material into the mix the calculations for it become troublesome. Scanning objects into a game is done somewhat like you said, put on a turntable and scanned. Other times it&#39;s having the camera move around a stationary object, reverse turntable?"
