content = '''I can relate to this.  I&#39;ve constantly written and re-written a 3D game engine completely from scratch multiple times since highschool (I&#39;m 24 now).  I too even do the UI from scratch (right down to writing an importer to parse a file containing character widths and one containing pictures of letters to render text letter by letter onto the screen).<br /><br />Each time my engine gets a lot better and usually involves some new technology or fundamental system of design I just learned about.  This latest iteration is the first I finally was able to admit to myself that I know I&#39;m going to end up starting over again because I&#39;ll learn something new.  So I&#39;m focusing on making it so that when I start over, I lose as little as possible.  Hopefully next time I start over (I have no idea when that will be, I can&#39;t control it at all), I&#39;ll be able to keep most of the code I wrote this iteration.<br /><br /><br />The closest I&#39;ve ever come to finishing an actual game was for a 30 hour hackathon competition where I made a game using my engine (and won 1st prize).  But the game wasn&#39;t quite complete, and I never bothered to finish it.'''
