title = "I think the actual root of this problem goes deepe..."
content = "I think the actual root of this problem goes deeper than just education. It&#39;s clearly an inevitable fact that the majority of people will not need to work for our society to flourish in the future. Automation will replace a great majority of jobs.  Teaching people how to be good workers (which is what traditional education does) or teaching them to be great thinkers (which is probably what we should be doing) isn&#39;t going to change the fact that there won&#39;t be jobs available for a large majority of people in the future (be they workers or thinkers). In fact, teaching people to be great thinkers now will only make that jobless future come more quickly. Though it will probably also help more people be capable of accepting such change.<br /><br />It seems at least partially likely that education hasn&#39;t shifted wholly toward teaching creativity and thinking because people who are complacent with the daily grind are easier to pacify and so long as we can keep enough remedial jobs to keep them employed, the status quo stays. I personally don&#39;t think the status quo is all so hot, and perhaps we should be pushing for change, but a whole lot of freethinking people have found ways to fit into this life, have found happiness, and got comfortable.<br /><br />For a more short-term view of the problem, I think society needs to stop over-valuing a university level education and appreciate folks who choose not to go to a university and instead go to a trade school, community college, or directly into the workforce. University level educations are expensive and there is a clear problem with student debt in our nation. There’s also a problem with using the least common denominator when teaching at the university level; I don’t think this should ever happen. If a student can’t keep up, then they don’t belong in the program they’re in. Alternatives need to exist, but dumbing down a subject isn’t the answer.<br /><br />It also seems that the large volume of students who now enroll in college because “it’s what comes after high school” has diluted what used to be a highly scholastic environment. But in all reality, college offers a lot of opportunity to go as deeply into the academic side of things as you want. Sure, you have to take the tests, and memorize the facts, but there&#39;s still plenty of opportunity to have the sort of experience you sought, at UW and elsewhere, if you seek it out. <br /><br />As you will ultimately find out life isn&#39;t going to just hand you thought provoking challenges that fulfill you. Nobody is going to just walk up to you and take you under their wing and say “hey kid, you could be the catalyst that changes the future for the better, let me teach you how to be the best you that you can be”. Based on this essay, I would say that you have somehow, in-spite of the less than awesome education system, managed to become a freethinking person who can think critically and analyze big problems and even come up with ideas that could contribute to fixing them. <br /><br />The thing is, life is exactly what you make of it, and you get out of it what you put into it. Like everything else in life, if you want a great education that challenges and fulfills you, you need to go get it and not expect someone else to hand it to you.<br />"
