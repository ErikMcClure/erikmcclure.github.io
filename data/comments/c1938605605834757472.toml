content = "Maybe it&#39;s only a small effect when compared with the greater things you&#39;re driven to accomplish, but even in simply communicating your values to the world, you begin to motivate other like-minded people to realize those values in their own lives and build upon them. After all, ideas are infectious, and your long-term legacy need not consist entirely of <em>your own</em> direct impacts echoing through time.<br /><br />Granted, I get the impression that spreading your views also tends to draw an endless slew of backlash and vitriol from opposing crowds. And yet somehow a dedication to defending your ideals against that onslaught, rather than sacrificing them for an easier walk through life, is what sets you apart from the majority in this respect."
