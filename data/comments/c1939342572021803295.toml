In public, not in secret. Yes, it is scary. Working by yourself can be fun, but collaboration can be even better. If all you do is toil away in the shadows, no one will ever know to give you the support you need.<br /><br />Do not try to create a magnum opus. Especially do not try to create multiple magna opera. If it is going to happen, it will happen whether you like it or not.<br /><br />There is an enormous difference between working for the sake of learning and idealism, and working to create an actual, useful thing. In particular, if you never make small hackish projects for practical purposes, then you never learn how to finish anything, or how to make work that matters to other people. This will drain you.<br /><br />So relax. Find a job. Find enjoyment in it. Spend your free time working on practical things. Post about them on Hacker News and Reddit and GameDev.net. Get suggestions and collaborators. Make something amazing and see how easy and rewarding it can be. And maybe then you can assemble a team and work together to really bring your ideas to life.<br /><br />There is time.<br />"
