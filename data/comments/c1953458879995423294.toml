content = '''I think you&#39;re confused.  You say that a company has zero motivation to improve GPL software because they can&#39;t benefit, but that is simply not true.  Many companies can *and do* benefit from such improvements, at the very least by using those improvements themselves and almost always in other ways.  In your &quot;ideal&quot; non-GPL universe you claim that people would be required to release their improvements back to the community.  Required how?  The lack of such a requirement is *exactly* what differentiates the licenses you prefer from GPL.  If you add such a requirement, you&#39;ve invented an ad-hoc, bug-ridden, inferior version of GPL.  Good job.  If you don&#39;t, then people can *and will* take your code, improve it, and *not* contribute back.  Good job again.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think everyone should use GPL.  In some ways I dislike it.  However, blaming it alone for license Balkanization is *absurd*.  If you want to preclude people from using your non-GPL code in a GPL project, because you&#39;re afraid that you won&#39;t get changes back, then &quot;anyone for any purpose&quot; and &quot;share with anyone&quot; ring more than a little hollow.  Your preference for a license that&#39;s morally equivalent to GPL but incompatible with the actual GPL will only increase license fragmentation, not resolve it.'''
