content = '''I have actually implemented dynamic timesteps before but I keep switching between dynamic and constant because I&#39;m not sure which one has the most benefits yet. The primary reason I wasn&#39;t using dynamic timesteps was because I wasn&#39;t sure what kind of consequences it might have for the physics calculations. It wasn&#39;t much a matter of ensuring determinism as simply not caring about determinism and being more concerned about not destabilizing the physics simulation by using timesteps that are so small they blow up the floating point inaccuracies.<br /><br />You can render faster than the physics time step and I think its useless. If your physics aren&#39;t rendering at a sufficiently high rate, everything else will suffer.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, you have a more nuanced understanding of determinism than I do, however, in your efforts to ensure it, you have made multiple sacrifices that I was not willing to make even for a nondeterministic multithreaded scenario. Hence, even if I was trying to enforce determinism, I would not accept your solution, because I do not want to render an inconsistent physics step and I will not accept an additional frame of input lag.<br /><br />I have, however, taken what you have said here to make a few small adjustments to my engine to ensure it actually is deterministic, since a primarily single-threaded engine should probably be deterministic anyway.'''
