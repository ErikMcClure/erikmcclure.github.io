The people are nice and my boss is pretty cool -- he&#39;s always trying to make sure that the projects are interesting and everyone has enough autonomy and that sort of thing.<br /><br />Still, though -- I do have to agree. Some people are into it, but I&#39;m just not the type to be happy stuck at a job like this -- I told my girlfriend at the time when I started the job that I&#39;d be depressed about doing this for the next 40 years!<br /><br />But it is a blessing. It finally gave me the kick in the ass I needed to come up with a good business and get out there to start making it happen -- plus the steady funds each week from my paycheck to fuel my endeavors. I don&#39;t plan on being here forever -- just long enough to make something better happen."
