content = '''I had came across this blog while contemplating the origin of ethics and had concluded we make ethic judgments based on scarcity/replace-ability of something and survival chance. From this line of thinking A human individual unto itself is rare and irreplaceable. There is and never will be an individual exactly like it once said individual is gone. This is one basis for placing a value on human life. The secondary basis, survival, if the action itself decreases survival chances, it is generally considered immoral or wrong. As humans are social creatures we all depend on each-other and form bonds and social links. Fewer bonds and links decrease your chances of survival or success. This is part of why trust and not going on a genocidal rampage is important. No one would associate with you if you did, and those that did associate could just as easily do the same to you, hence decreased chances for survival! Going with this same line of thought because humans are part of the human species, humans are generally considered more important than animals. This in itself is a survival bias. Not putting a higher priority on one&#39;s own species means decreased chances for survival. I believe this may be the basis for many human-centric ethical issues.'''
