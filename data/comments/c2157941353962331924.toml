It&#39;s more of a problem with the workforce in general, and it&#39;s that we have essentially begun to take human beings out of the picture.  Machines are now performing tasks that human beings once did, and in some sense, are more proficient at it.  But that&#39;s about where it ends.  Machines are still machines, and I think human beings are relying on them far too much to do even the most remedial tasks.  We really haven&#39;t taken into consideration that, while machines do an excellent job at performing the tasks we assign them (ie.  never get tired, cranky, or complain), we&#39;re forgetting that many families are losing their primary breadwinner to it.  And that has a huge impact on the economics of any society.  So yes, while machines and the tools to make them do what we want them to are more &quot;productive&quot; than we can think, the outcome in the end is disastrous at best and a calamity at worst."
