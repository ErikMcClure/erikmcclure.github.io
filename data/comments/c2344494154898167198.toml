content = "Hi Erik, I shared your sentiment in early high school.  In high school, all anyone cared about were the three acronyms:  GPA, SAT, ACT.  I don&#39;t think classes really fostered a whole lot of creativity.  <br /><br />However, this did not discourage me from attending classes and achieving good scores, because I realized that the classroom environment&#39;s primary purpose is not to improve one&#39;s creative thinking, but to either 1.Develop one into a well rounded individual, or 2.Give tools that can be applied with creative thinking.  Because I understood the goals of the classroom environment, and having experienced the Japanese education system (which is much more test centered - search &quot;juku&quot; or &quot;yobikou&quot; or &quot;ronin&quot;), school was something I looked forward to.<br /><br />I am reading the comments and I notice that these folks are asking you to offer up an alternative solution to this so called &quot;Race to Nowhere&quot;.  You don&#39;t have to, because you are trying to address a problem that does not exist in the way you think it does.  As I stated above, the classroom environment is not there to foster creativity.  Creativity is encouraged, fostered, and expanded in the project environment.  In middle school, high school, and undergrad education, that means clubs, like the FIRST Robotics Competition, Odyssey of the Mind, Engineers Without Borders, Formula SAE, and many, many other clubs.  In grad school, that means research as you and your team try to expand the frontier of human knowledge.<br /><br />What we learn in school is useful.  Tests are good at determining whether you have at least attempted to understand the material they gave you.  Clubs, teams, projects, and research opportunities demand that you know the material, and will teach you how to use the tools learned in lecture to solve real world problems.<br /><br />Creativity isn&#39;t something one learns in lecture.  It&#39;s something one practices in producing an end product.  And unless people understand that fundamental difference, they will never be satisfied with their academic education."
