content = "You know, many of the incredible things that seem so trivial in the world today took so damned long to perfect when they were first developed - try not to stick your mind too far ahead of things, it would just be that you feel like something *should* be trivial when in practice it&#39;s far far harder than you&#39;d expect - that&#39;s easy to fall into when it seems that pretty much every average person around you (or even your peers) is an idiot.<br /><br />I really can&#39;t emphasise this enough, but it&#39;s highly admirable how determined you are - I kind of admire you for that, how you manage to get knocked down and keep getting up... Actually, sometimes you genuinely inspire me.<br /><br />Don&#39;t burn yourself out all the time - you have a while to generate your life&#39;s work still. There&#39;s a lot of amazing things out there to experience, and it&#39;s all so inspiring."
