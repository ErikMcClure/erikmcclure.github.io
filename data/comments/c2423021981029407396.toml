It took a long time and there were many failures but a lot happens in 30+ years of programming (I started when I was eleven :-) So don&#39;t give up. You are young and have a lot to learn. And how do you learn to make things? By making things over and over again until you finally have enough knowledge to get it right. I have written 3 game engines as a professional game developer and I am still looking for perfection and probably always will. The key is to accept it and move on. And it definitely helps to get a job where you can do what you love while getting paid for it :-)"
