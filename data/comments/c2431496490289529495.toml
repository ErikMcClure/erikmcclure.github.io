content = "i agree with about half of your post - http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/ToWashItAllAway.pdf is one of the best things I&#39;ve ever read. garbage collection and pure functional programming is not the enemy though. they aren&#39;t responsible for the bloat, or for how broken all the software is. the only thing that will truly allow people to write correct, functional software with fewer layers between themselves and the hardware is going to be more of that, not less. software is broken because people do a poor job of repeating the same damn thing over and over again. half assed frameworks and testing / development methodologies arise because there&#39;s a need for people to take some of the repetition out of things, but the tools they are writing these frameworks in and methodologies for aren&#39;t strong enough (which is why they need the frameworks and methodologies in the first place). lower level tools won&#39;t help with half of your laundry list of complaints<br /><br />but yes, death to javascript and the web browser as an operating system. agh"
