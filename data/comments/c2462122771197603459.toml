content = "There is more to life than programming. The universe is made of many systems of many abstractions. You are certainly a talented creator (artist).<br /><br />Now, it seems like time to try something different that is not programming related. It&#39;s a personal path. Some things that changed my life that I learned are continuously becoming more self aware of my thoughts and actions, Buddhism, Transcendental Meditation, becoming vegan/health conscious, hanging out with artists.<br /><br />Discover what really drives you regardless of circumstance &amp; knowledge. I strive toward mastery in what I am involved with. Like the elder sushi chef who continuously improves the practice, I expect this to be a lifelong endeavor.<br /><br />Get to know people who you wouldn&#39;t normally hang out with. Date someone &quot;out of your league&quot;. Resist getting tied down into a particular spot. Try to get a remote-friendly gig.<br /><br />Reality can be a series of wonderful games, if you play the right ones :-)<br />Most people &amp; institutions will try to make you play the wrong games, or games that are good for them, probably at your soul&#39;s expense."
