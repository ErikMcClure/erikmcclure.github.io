content = '''Hello Erik. As a current student at UW I&#39;d like to submit my thoughts on this post. I&#39;ve given a lot of thought to the many questions you address, and have discussed these with many students at several universities (including fancy places such as Harvard/MIT/Stanford). <br /><br />First of all, I agree with you entirely about the flaws in primary and secondary school education. Unfortunately, many high school and elementary school teachers simply _do not know_ what mathematics is - they learned it much the same way that you describe: via memorization. They can only teach what they know, and this is indeed a fundamental flaw of the system. Many more math-focused countries have mathematics graduate students and PhDs teach at primary schools, but this requires an infrastructure and culture that we do not have here. However, I would like to mention the growing movement of &quot;Math Circles&quot; - small classes of middle school students that teach proof-based abstract mathematics. The goal of these to to supplement primary school mathematics education with a more rigorous proof-based approach studying topics such as combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory. UW hosts one too, by the way.<br /><br />All that said, must disagree with about what you say about our UW education. Yes, there is certainly a route to a degree that does not require anything more than memorization, but there are also many routes that involve minimal jumping-through-the-hoops. The beauty of college (and America in general) is that you can customize your education _however you see fit_ - there is a plan set in stone for those who want to follow it, but you are more than welcome to carve your own path. I, for instance, managed to convince professors to let me substitute many of my required courses in physics and chemistry for their graduate equivalents because the subject matter of the courses was fascinating to me and I wanted a more challenging environment. These graduate courses were indeed extremely challenging and demanded a tremendous amount of thought - they would have been impossible to succeed in if I were to simply memorize my way through them. The mathematics department, contrary to what you say, offers very difficult undergraduate courses. Yes, to find these you have to seek out the courses with long, difficult-sounding names (&quot;Honors Accelerated Advanced Calculus&quot; or &quot;Special Topics in Differential Geometry&quot;) - but it&#39;s unfair to say that courses do not exist or do not make you think. I don&#39;t think you can memorize your way through any of the upper-level courses.<br /><br />The kernel of my argument can be summarized as follows: college is an opportunity. Most people enter college to obtain a degree - a piece of paper that says that they have a particular set of skills - and this can certainly be obtained by memorizing away (one could argue that this is sufficient for most post-bac applications!). Many other students have the goal of pursuing science and mathematics into graduate school and perhaps further, and such people seek out courses that prepare them for the kind of thinking and problem solving that is required in graduate school. From my limited experience at other universities - this is very much the case everywhere in the US.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to point out that you have completely ignored the concept of academic research: the heart of scientific thought and problem solving. Undergraduate students are actively encouraged to approach professors with requests to join their academic group and work on the frontiers of science and mathematics, and this is arguably one of the best ways to obtain the &quot;thinking&quot; component of college that you discuss in your post.<br /><br />For the sake of not dragging out this response, I will end my argument here. Please let me know if this is something you would like to discuss further.'''
