Theoretically maybe, but the interpolation itself is almost as expensive as simply calculating the reflection, because by definition it would have to be at least a quadratic equation. Even then, this is incredibly pointless, because modern games no longer use such basic lighting curves anyway, they use curves like the Oren-Nayar reflectance model: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oren%E2%80%93Nayar_reflectance_model."
