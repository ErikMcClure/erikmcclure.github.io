content = "No no no, it doesn&#39;t mean you are doing something fundamentally wrong. Do you know how easy it is to make the money to pay your rent if you really wanted to? The problem is you are trying to have the best of two worlds. This is a lot harder! What you are trying to do is take two different paths at the same time and I can tell you from personal experience that this is tough. I understand, you have these dreams/ideas, but they do not overlap perfectly with your monetary goals. That&#39;s cool. I get that. I have the same problem. <br /><br />Personally, I have similar issues. I have these projects I am working on, and at the same time I need to find a way to pay the bills soon. You can spend say 50% of your energy on working for money and 50% on working on your projects, but you would get a lot more done if you could spend closer to 100% of your energy on these projects.  The problem is obviously not your ability, it is how you are allocating your energy. You are not superman. "
