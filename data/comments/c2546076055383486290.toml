content = "Also your string doesn&#39;t have a null terminator, either, which is an even more elementary problem. This is why you usually don&#39;t use an array on the stack to store strings, you just define a constant &quot;TEST\n&quot; and throw around a pointer to it, which the compiler does for you when you say const char* val=&quot;TEST\n&quot;;"
