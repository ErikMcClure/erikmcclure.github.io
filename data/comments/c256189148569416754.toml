content = "Interesting. As a hardcore gamer i&#39;ve always spent alot of time tweaking and trying to sync mouse input to the screen&#39;s refresh rate. It worked with Id&#39;s quake engines and the ps/2 rate utility back in the day..  but now we have &quot;cpu swallowing&quot; usb updating at 250/333hz .. <br /><br />About the cpu issue with vsync, i&#39;d rather have 1 cpu core at 100%, than my graphics card doing 2000 frames when i only get to see 60 of them. For the environments sake ;)"
