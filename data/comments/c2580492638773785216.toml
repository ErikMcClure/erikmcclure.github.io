content = '''Now I absolutely believe in connectivity between humans minds. I was going to write very similar thoughts  (although yours are better converted to words), to criticize approach &quot;don&#39;t waste your time on what is created&quot; (when you see it&#39;s created awful), to criticize Brendan Eich for his &quot;we don&#39;t need nothing except JS in browsers&quot; narrow-minded approach.<br />We REALLY need more tools, more foundations, more languages, more libraries and more companies working on the same things. And we shouldn&#39;t be inert to learn new things! Otherwise we will forever stuck with Facebook as a &quot;main&quot; social network, Google as a &quot;main&quot; search engine, and all evolution will be slowed down because of lack of competition.<br />People waste tremendous amount of time to waste TV serials, and we are arguing about some time to reinvent the wheels? Make them flying already!'''
