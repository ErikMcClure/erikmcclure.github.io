content = '''Richard, this is what tenure is for. Tenure more or less guarantees teachers their jobs. They&#39;re supposed to challenge the status quo and do something outrageous. <br /><br />A lot of times at research schools (like UW) that shows up in their research more often than their teaching. But many faculty members bring their research into their classrooms, and most (if not all) involve students on some level, though this is sometimes restricted to graduate level students.<br /><br />My advice for anyone pursuing an education at a research university is to get involved with a research project that excites and interests them. It&#39;s a -great- way to learn, and also a good way to help you score a job after your tenure ends.'''
