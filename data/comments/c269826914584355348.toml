content = "I am currently attempting to build something that is specifically not supposed to be a magnum opus, and still having difficulty doing it. For approximately 3 years I&#39;ve tried to finish things only to repeatedly fail for various reasons, usually because the projects were too large. I have repeteadly shrunk them and have gotten to the point where one of my ideas is within reach, only to subsequently discover that I was still fucked because CEGUI is terrible and I can&#39;t build the GUI or tools necessary to make the game happen, even though I FINALLY have an engine and an idea that can actually be done. This is my current predicament. If I can&#39;t get this much smaller idea working, I&#39;m going to be close to giving up, because I&#39;ve reigned myself in so much there&#39;s not much left. I&#39;ve already met a lot of amazing people. Unfortunately we all have our own problems."
