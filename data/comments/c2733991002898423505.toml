content = '''In some ways I am spared from the chaos that normally involves such undertakings, becuase I never wanted outside funding in the first place, even if I could get it. I never got invited to parties in the first place. My friends from high school moved away and my social life is largely on the internet, sprinkled with the occasional excursion to meet an online friend at a convention. I only lived at college for 3 months before running back home out of digust, so I already live with my parents. My parents actually are rather supportive of what I want to do but will eventually require me to get a normal job once I&#39;m out of college.<br /><br />But of course, I can&#39;t stop. It&#39;s not possible for me to stop. That isn&#39;t an option anymore.'''
