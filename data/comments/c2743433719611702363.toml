content = '''I agree that their are major flaws in education as a whole but I think far too many people over generalize the way you are. I think that many schools are crappy and should be avoided but some are amazing and awesome places to learn.<br />My biggest issue. Is the way you say higher education doesn&#39;t foster creativity. At my university creativity is huge and in high level math and cs classes teachers openly encourage students to come up with new and unique ideas and ways of doing things. I agree that their are many schools that dont do this but as a student or parent its your job to recognize when a school is not doing a good job and to find a better one. If a student actively believes that they are only learning how to fill in bubbles and make good guesses they need to man up and find a better school. Also on a sude note I&#39;ve never taken a scantron test at university.  <br />If parents and students stand up and refuse to attend schools that work the way you claim yours have the system will correct itself.  Great schools will get more money and grow and bad ones will wither and die out. Blaming the system is just a way of pushing the blame off yourself. '''
