content = '''As a software engineer/artist myself, I sympathize.<br /><br />But I don&#39;t think I&#39;m hyperimaginative, as you seem to be (I&#39;m probably more in the synaesthesia category).  I can certainly think of artists who were -- HP Lovecraft and CS Lewis come to mind -- and from what I know of their lives it is probably as much a curse, as a blessing.  (Do you happen to have frequent vivid dreams as well?)<br /><br />Jon Purdy speaks wisdom.  Read his comment again.<br /><br />Bottom line is that, whether the path be professional, entrepreneur, or starving artist, you will not again have the same volume of time and opportunity to work on what you love, for a while -- until you retire or otherwise achieve financial independence.  Something&#39;s got to give, so figure out what would be the least painful to let give, and let it give.<br /><br />If you can find some way to deal with your exacting perfectionism, that will likely make things a lot easier.  This will help a lot if you go the professional route too, because as a software engineer, at some point you&#39;ll almost certainly have to deal with some technology which makes your perfectionist self scream THIS SUCKS SO BAD I SWEAR I AM GOING TO GO BLIND FROM IT, and replacing it will simply not be a viable option; you just have to learn to make do.<br /><br />I&#39;m frankly a little skeptical that you truly need a whole new generation of tools before you can start implementing your ideas -- or that you could not start with a crappy GUI and iterate.  Try hard to distinguish between the &quot;criticals&quot; and the &quot;nice to haves&quot;.  Have you tried mocking up your ideas in storyboards on paper?  What exactly is it about them that is unattainable with what we have today?  What parts could be approximated with what we have today?  Could you build those into a demo which would communicate the promise of something better?<br /><br />&quot;The best is the enemy of the good&quot; -- Voltaire'''
