content = "Whether or not your customer information gets stolen is not the point. The point is the sophistication of the attack required to steal the passwords. If you have a high security rating, it means an attacker would have to carry out a sophisticated attack (probably involving social engineering) to grab your customer data. If you do not have a high security rating it means you could fall prey to well known vulnerabilities. Most of the websites being hacked today are not being hacked by a super-sophisticated attacker, they just have absolutely terrible security."
