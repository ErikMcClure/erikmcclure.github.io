content = "Calling 3D Makers artists but programmer not, is lächerlich. Maybe you did not mind it. Just a remark.<br /><br />In your say something and just after that the contrary or don&#39;t apply the same reasoning. I promised my virtual partner not to stay too log in front of the computer because of «someone is wrong». You wrote it somewhere else in your blog that «EVERYBODY IS AN IDIOT» so I assume, you are too, just like myself.<br /><br />For instance «If you&#39;re building GTA V, you can&#39;t somehow manage to come up with three hundred unique histories for every single suburban house you&#39;re building.». You just wrote before, «Modern photorealism, like the 3D graphics of ages past, is smoke and mirrors, the result of very talented programmers and artists using tricks of the eye to convince you that a level is much more detailed and interactive than it really is.». Those issues can be considered the same &quot;problem&quot; even if you come up with different conclusions. &quot;300 unique histories&quot; might not be required &amp; it&#39;s not impossible and can be done in 3 years.<br /><br />You seem to have a lot of time to write. I find this *very* *very* admirable. I&#39;m impressed. I&#39;d like to write as much as you.<br /><br />Quick listening of your tunes on bandcamp, try https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijiAas3DI2U<br /><br />HTH"
