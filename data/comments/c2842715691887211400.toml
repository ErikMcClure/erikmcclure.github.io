content = '''I didn&#39;t SAY your extrapolation invalidated the physics state, I said that you RENDER an invalid physics state!<br /><br />I keep pointing out problems and then you keep misinterpreting them.<br /><br />Uh, every single solution I have ever written involves constant timesteps. Because I use Box2D. So yes, it is all deterministic. Sorry. Doing physics with a constant timestep is as simple as using box2D&#39;s accumulation method, which my method would do, and furthermore I argue that trying to render frames in between physics calculations is worthless because the extrapolation simply introduces artifacts, and if you can&#39;t render physics at 60 FPS you&#39;re screwed anyway. Hence, physics are blocking, and if they aren&#39;t blocking you either 1. aren&#39;t deterministic or 2. are extrapolating positions widely and are therefore rendering frames with an invalid physics state, even if the internal physics state is correct.<br /><br />So I contend that trying to render faster than the physics timestep is useless, and therefore your solution is useless.'''
