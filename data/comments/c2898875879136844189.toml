content = '''I din&#39;t know you saw that as immoral. Most guys your age have no problem with pirating. My philosophy is: if you need something right now and can&#39;t afford it go ahead and download it, just make sure that if it&#39;s a good product you give back to society and to the developer eventually. I agree it would be immoral if you outright stole it. But if you are in a tight situation, and you need it to further your altruistic goals then so what. As long as you pay the developer in the next year or so..<br /><br />I donno man, it&#39;s complicated. '''
