content = "Hi, I&#39;ve also created multithreading (separate update and render thread), but don&#39;t come the conclusion that it isn&#39;t worth it. True, it is very difficult to implement decently, but it is worth it for games that require lots of CPU. The goals is to seperate the render-state from the world-state so you can triple buffer the render state. The delay you talk about can be &#39;solved&#39; using partial synchronization and extrapolation.<br /><br />For an explanation of the problem please check out:<br /><a href=\"http://blog.slapware.eu/game-engine/programming/multithreaded-renderloop-part1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.slapware.eu/game-engine/programming/multithreaded-renderloop-part1/</a><br /><a href=\"http://blog.slapware.eu/game-engine/programming/multithreaded-renderloop-part2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.slapware.eu/game-engine/programming/multithreaded-renderloop-part2/</a><br /><br />The website discusses the problems and shows a decent (though difficult) solution. Both source and binaries can be downloaded."
