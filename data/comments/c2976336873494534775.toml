content = "*I learned that creativity is useless and all problems have one specific right answer you can find in the back of a textbook somewhere, because that&#39;s all I was ever graded on*<br /><br />I feel like this has more to do with the courses (and professors) you selected than anything else, because this certainly wasn&#39;t my college experience.  I still remember the first professor who told me that &quot;If your plan is to repeat the case study back to me across five pages, you&#39;re probably going to fail.  I have 80 students and I don&#39;t like to read the same paper 80 times.  You don&#39;t learn anything, and I get bored.  If you want an A, your paper will be a truly original thought, something that could be developed into a publishable thesis.&quot;<br /><br />Sure, I also had some profs where education was a self-service affair, who cared about educating only so much as it paid for their graduate studies, but I also had great professors who cared about a true education.<br />"
