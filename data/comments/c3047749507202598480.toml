content = '''I strongly disagree! I&#39;m a high school freshman and the reason I abhor math is because of the constant problems and practice sheets teachers assign. I have never feared the subject but I don&#39;t want to do it. I don&#39;t want to sit and do 30 freaking problems on something I probably will never use unless I become a scientist or mathematician. They need to come out and show us why it matters how much distance Tom covered when he walked to and from the store.'''
