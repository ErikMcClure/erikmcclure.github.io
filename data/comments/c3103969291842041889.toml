content = "Erik... I haven&#39;t had a chance to read much else on your blog, but I too quite likely would be considered a &quot;delusional idealist&quot; by society&#39;s standards. You seem to be on the path of the journeyman programmer and one day will be an expert and then some.<br /><br />For some context I am turning 35 in less than a month and have yet to release my life&#39;s work which extends over 11 years of effort after my college degree. A significant amount of my efforts cover similar ground as your aspirations. I still live month to month (~$200 in my bank account right now and significant debt I incurred in following this path I&#39;m still trying to manage). By the time that I do launch my effort I will have spent well over 15k hours on it. I often think about how life would be if I was paid my corporate contract rate for those hours.<br /><br />While aggressive refactoring may occur in your efforts from time to time I suppose realize that there is an inherent truth and logic in ones work. For me it brings the only solid peace of mind in an uncertain / illogical world. It is the reason I&#39;m writing this right now.<br /><br />It sounds like you are just finishing up your degree... If possible move back w/ your family. Let me tell you... It sucks, it sucks, it sucks... I did for 3 years after my degree and faced daily admonition &amp; nagging from my parents on why I didn&#39;t have a job. It was even harder to deal w/ their assumptions that I was &quot;unemployable&quot; / not good at my chosen path. Despite knowing none of that was true it&#39;s still hard when the only understanding most folks understand is your job / title / income one might gain from employment.   <br /><br />I even spoke at various conferences and this had no effect on my families opinion. I suppose you could say I lucked out after my first major tech conference because an O&#39;Reilly editor was in the audience and I got an invite to the &#39;04 Foo Camp. I distinctly remember sitting at a table chatting w/ the &quot;Hot or Not&quot; founders who were quite successful by that time. I remember desperately trying to conceal I was living in my parents basement, had no income, and what not. <br /><br />Outside funding is going to be a bitch as unfortunately investors do not favor tools development despite how innovative they may be. You&#39;ll likely find yourself bootstrapping and need to release your work before you receive any sort of favorable discussion. The upside is that you&#39;ll retain 100% ownership. <br /><br />Does it get better? I&#39;m not going to lie... Things can get pretty shitty and daunting at times from economic to social relationships from friends to potential significant others. You may often find yourself pushed into out-group situations. I recently even faced this by general neighborhood friends of ~5-7 years.. Few people will understand why you may not show up too often on the weekends. It sucks when you stop getting invites to social events and see folks post pictures at them while you are working around the clock late into the evening Friday / Sat night. I can&#39;t even mention to potential dates that I run my own long term R&amp;D oriented company and work nights and weekends quite often; doesn&#39;t matter if they work in the tech industry either.<br /><br />Hah.. Well I have to get back to coding as the midnight oil has been burning since last night. <br /><br />Don&#39;t stop... embrace the inherent truth / logic of your efforts... take solace that you can code fearlessly and without requiring permission from anyone else. You will rarely find this freedom as an employee or from inside the industry. Be bold and do things differently. It&#39;s not going to be easy by any means. "
