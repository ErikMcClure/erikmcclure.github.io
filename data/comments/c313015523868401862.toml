content = '''Wrote something similar to this earlier last year in response to a politically correct &quot;language guide&quot; being used by some schools.  You might enjoy it:<br />https://www.pftq.com/blabberbox/?page=Political_Correctness_is_1984---s_Newspeak<br /><br />Matt Walsh also has a pretty hilarious piece on something people have come up with called &quot;microaggressions&quot; (aka you are offending me but you just don&#39;t know it):<br />http://themattwalshblog.com/2014/09/16/sorry-but-its-your-fault-if-your-offended-all-the-time/<br /><br />It&#39;s pretty crazy now.  There seems to be a self-righteous attitude where it&#39;s almost like people think they&#39;re going out of their way to &quot;save&quot; or &quot;enlighten&quot; you whether you want their opinion or not.  The sad part is you think this is just the internet - come to Silicon Valley more often and you get quite a few people who act that way in real life (of course, not everyone but enough to bug you on a day-to-day basis).  Like you said, it&#39;s as if someone were hounding you to your car as you were trying to go about your regular day.  Somewhere along the line we&#39;ve confused right to speak with right to be heard.'''
