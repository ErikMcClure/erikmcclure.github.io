content = "Well, what about in life?  I find this dissertation parallel to many of life&#39;s precarious situations.  Most of the time, I think the concept of right and wrong is a means to an end.  It is a gross method of oversimplification in order for people to justify coming to conclusions to things they do not readily understand.  In a way, static &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;wrongs&quot; do not belong in life, because it leaves open the door for individual interpretation.  What may be considered right and just by one person will most assuredly be considered cruel and wrong by another.<br /><br />In any other case, it&#39;s nothing more than an ego boost.  One wants to see himself as right, impeccable, and infallible when in reality one is never any of these things.  And even when one commits to wrongs, he will most assuredly have an excuse readily available pertaining as to why he did wrong instead of right.<br /><br />The bottom line -- there is no black and white, only varying shades of grey."
