content = "Physics has always been a problem for me. You can&#39;t just shut off physics for objects beyond a certain distance because you can often still see the objects in question. You can reduce the load, but again that requires a specialized physics solution that, AFAIK, does not currently exist. AI is only not a problem because the techniques we are using deliberately don&#39;t use very much CPU. You are making rash assumptions about the fundamental complexity of a given calculations based entirely off current approximations that seem &quot;good enough&quot;.<br /><br />I am specifically interested in trying to push the boundaries of what really is &quot;good enough&quot;, and these almost invariably require massive increases in the computational complexity for physics. AI I do not know enough about to comment.<br /><br />1. Doesn&#39;t matter. The problem is not rendering speed, its information.<br /><br />2. Gives minimal benefit to raytracing.<br /><br />3. Actually, you do. I have specifically noticed the flat, boring, obviously fake textures used by modern games on the ground. While this is fine for most cases, the ground right next to the character needs to be fully modeled and interacted with, which is doable in terms of rendering, but introduces massive problems in terms of information storage and physics. This problem has not yet been solved by procedural generation in a satisfactory way, which is why we need to work on it more.<br /><br />4. Very, very wrong. The entire fact that background objects &quot;don&#39;t need&quot; physics is what makes most games seem boring as shit, because nothing in the background ever moves. This is a PROBLEM, not a solution. You are free to not believe me simply because no one has managed to do this yet because its too expensive, but I promise I will simply prove you wrong in another 5 years.<br /><br />5. Completely wrong. Try simulating an entire global economy with millions of interacting NPCs in a space MMO like EVE. Have fun!<br /><br />6. This doesn&#39;t work for raytracing, or not in any real way that wouldn&#39;t be absorbed into the approximation algorithm itself.<br /><br />7. If your lighting is consistent, your game is boring.<br /><br />I personally believe many of these problems can be solved by rasterization, and that&#39;s one of the reasons I wrote the article, but you are looking at this from the perspective of the current game industry and what is currently accepted as &quot;good enough&quot;. It won&#39;t be good enough when someone else makes something better."
