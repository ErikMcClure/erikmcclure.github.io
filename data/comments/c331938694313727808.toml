content = '''Interesting experience. I&#39;ve personally found that multi-threading is a lot more stable as long as you manage the latency. As you&#39;ve said, it isn&#39;t easy, but it can be done. I normally use threads for physics and rendering, and then also sub-divide the work in individual threads as is possible - e.g. using 2 or 4 threads for a particle simulation update, splitting the world up and working in different areas in the physics loop on different threads. Additionally, networking and audio are easier to manage on their own threads and then feed events back into the main physics loop. The physics loop can be tightly timed (e.g. running 120hz or more, tightly synchronised with other sub-systems or over the network) and I&#39;ve also been investigating running a physics loop with double buffering to avoid locking for rendering. There are many interesting possibilities to utilise 8 hardware backed threads or more!'''
