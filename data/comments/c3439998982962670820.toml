content = "That&#39;s the biggest problem in schools these days, overall - we&#39;re consistently underestimating the capacity of kids. They&#39;re like sponges - give them some information, they&#39;ll absorb it. Will they understand it? Maybe. Maths is only one example.<br /><br />Numbers in first grade? Great. Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, fractions... you could at least suggest at that in first grade, and definitely teach all of it by second grade. Advance the program. Partial fractions? You can learn that as soon as you understand factorisation of polynomials. Complex numbers? Don&#39;t leave them until last year of high school - the basic concept of complex numbers was outlined to us using a picture book for Montessori levels! They&#39;re fun, they&#39;re different... they&#39;re probably not useful if you&#39;re not an engineer, but at least they&#39;re different!<br /><br />I was casually trying to explain basic molecules (like OÂ²) to a 2nd grader back when I was in primary school. Now I&#39;ll also add they hadn&#39;t even tried to teach chemistry *at all* in primary school. I was talking to a 2nd grader, and I was in 7th, and she did have some clue what I was talking about. She wouldn&#39;t have understood the whole idea, but something was clicking. If I&#39;d been taught better at the time, I could&#39;ve drawn some diagrams, and she probably would&#39;ve gotten it - instant high schooler! (at current level of education)<br /><br />Children are *far* more intelligent than people assume, and we wouldn&#39;t have these terrible rates of children actually staying through to the end of high school, and the following shortages of college graduates, or skills shortages, if we actually kept kids stimulated. Kids aren&#39;t staying in school? They&#39;re bored! Delinquency rates? They have nothing interesting to think about!<br /><br />@alankdkd I&#39;m not sure the missing steps would matter if we were moving at a more realistic pace. The steps that are skipped are usually something you spend ages and ages on two topics before... about a month ago!"
