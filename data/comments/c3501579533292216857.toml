content = '''Just reposted the deleted comment properly formatted.<br /><br />I think it really depends what you call raytracing, renderers like Arnold or Maxwell using Bidirectional Path Tracing ( Which is raytracing )achieve easily a picture quality where you cannot distinguish the generated from the real.<br /><br />I guess your definition of raytracing is very restrictive.<br /><br />You should talk about a specific implementation instead of speaking about raytracing in general because for instance Photon Mapping is based on raytracing.'''
