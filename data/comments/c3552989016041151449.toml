I have recently taken an even more concrete stance on the importance of simplicity and am in the middle of a massive rewrite of my graphics engine that tears out as much unnecessary complexity as possible through a series of algorithmic and structural changes to the code base.<br /><br />I have 2 ultimate projects, but I haven&#39;t started either. I&#39;m trying very hard to get to the point where I can start one of them, since I believe that will end up leading to my own personal magnum opus and I can use that as a stepping stone to team up with a bunch of other brilliant people and produce a second, collective magnum opus. I don&#39;t know if its going to work."
