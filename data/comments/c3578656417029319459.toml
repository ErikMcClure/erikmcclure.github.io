content = '''Ah, come on. Most of the elements in the assembled image are taken from photo reference, and silhouetted using brightness/contrast functions. There weren&#39;t &quot;drawn&quot;.<br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong. It&#39;s cool.<br /><br />But seriously, the full scale image is a project more like a research paper than it is a drawing. It&#39;s a matter of gathering usable images, and treating them with filters, and then assembling them. It&#39;s like gathering your favorite tracts of text from an encyclopedia, and then running search and replace/spell check functions. Keeping the images in scale with each other, and working with a very large image, while keeping it free of defects are the true difficulties. That problem is solved the same way it&#39;s processed, square by square. 225 x 225 is a lot, but many get thrown out as white space or black space.<br /><br />Yes, I understand that the picture is annotated with Randall&#39;s characters, but those annotations to the image would have been done in-line, while Randall is stitching together the image and inspecting it for flaws.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t impressive in it&#39;s own right, but the scale of it&#39;s difficulty should be measured by the count of individual recognizable elements, not it&#39;s literal dimensions, or how many tiles. The dimensions are a by-product of the included elements.'''
