content = '''Erik, you&#39;re a nutjob and I love the hell out of you. Seriously, you do make me smile for some of the strangest reasons that I can&#39;t describe.<br /><br />But that aside, I can see where jim comes from (the medication comment nearly knocked me off my chair though). There&#39;s a lot to say about you that since having the general crap that is study out of the way (and what productive person doesn&#39;t find that a waste of time? On average, it&#39;s an extremely inefficient way to learn, albeit more effective than is apparent), I&#39;m actually pretty pleased to say that you seem happier overall. Problems as above? Noted, but taking things one step at a time, the problem is that you compare yourself too pessimistically (pessimism is healthy, but there&#39;s too much as well) - the average person&#39;s goal, in terms of the more &quot;accommodated&quot; individuals, is to get a job, end of story. You get a job, and then you resign yourself to whatever happens from there. Plenty of people are capable of more, they just don&#39;t, and I think that&#39;s why it always feels like there&#39;s so few people doing amazing things these days. You&#39;re not like that, but pardon if I beat around the bush a bit more, because I&#39;m pretty bad with words when it comes to these things - it&#39;s an intrinsically abstract concept to me that&#39;s hard to describe.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t expect you to become a master of the universe within a few steps of graduating, working entirely on your own - the world isn&#39;t very conducive to that sort of way of working, and never was. It was a bit more common some years ago, but things aren&#39;t changing, and you&#39;re not going to change that yet, you&#39;re crazy!<br /><br />... Yet.<br /><br />There are a lot of skills that don&#39;t come from being intelligent, knowing how to deal with complicated matrix transformations, or being able to navigate the logical processes of programming. The skills that just don&#39;t come inherent are skills that I&#39;m working on (and somewhat, trying to figure out exactly what&#39;s missing, but I can&#39;t say how much I&#39;ve changed in the past year that&#39;s improved me), but I&#39;m not entirely convinced you&#39;ve perfected them yet either. jim might be onto something with the networking thing, although his specific suggestions (eg. relocating) I don&#39;t know if they really suit your needs. It might have nothing to do with that either, but you&#39;re just missing something important that you haven&#39;t correctly identified yet, and I can&#39;t really help you with that directly. Dare I say, in as few words as possible, maybe you just can&#39;t see the woods for the trees.'''
