content = '''Interesting post. I haven&#39;t worked with VS in a while, so I can&#39;t get into the fine detail. But the question that enters my mind is: why is this not a &#39;ribbon&#39; type interface?<br /><br />The ribbon interface was invented at MS and has a number of benefits. 1. It&#39;s always the same size. 2. Every command can be executed with the keyboard. 3. Icons are grouped and the most important ones (by frequency) are bigger.<br /><br />I&#39;m in favor of docking windows, but it&#39;s always hard to get it right. Your suggestion to make a collapsible panel is pretty good. I hate it when the docked windows pop up and eat sceen space from other docked windows.'''
