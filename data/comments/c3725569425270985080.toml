content = '''I am hesitant about publishing my alternative ideas, because they are just wild theories I have, and ideally I would want to do actual research into their effectiveness before advocating any of them. I&#39;m a scientist, I want to work with experimental data, but obviously I just got out of college and am nearly broke, so I can&#39;t really do any real research towards this.<br /><br />I may publish a number of my alternative theories later with a big fat &quot;I HAVE NO IDEA IF ANY OF THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORK BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY IT ANYWAY?&quot; disclaimer on them.'''
