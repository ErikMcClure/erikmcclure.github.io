content = '''Ok, but creating tones/effects is a skill in itself. With practice you can get very good at thinking of a specific sound in your head and knowing exactly how to create it from scratch. You do&#39;t need to pay hundreds of dollars for libraries. You can pirate that all for free. You just need a digital piano/keyboard/synthesizer and you can create and upload all the effects you need.'''
