It&#39;s shareholders.<br /><br />Of course the interests of its&#39; customers will suffer. Of course the interests of its&#39; users will suffer. Of course the interests of its&#39; staff will suffer. Of course the interests of the general public will suffer.<br /><br /><br />Don&#39;t be evil?<br /><br />Ain&#39;t no room for that sort of sentimental nonsense.<br /><br /><br />It is a little difficult to feel bad about this, because a lot of shareholders are pension funds working in the interests of ordinary working-class people, so this isn&#39;t really a proxy for class war. The problem is that investors, including institutional investors and pension funds, are all incapable of making long-term predictions, so they all invest for the short-term, with holding periods measured in months rather than years. They are also incapable of balancing moral judgements with returns-based investment, or have no mandate to incorporate that into their decision making process. <br /><br />Management decisions in publicly-owned companies reflect this reality. They reflect the fact that long term investing is impossible by focusing on short-term profits. They reflect the fact that pension funds have no social-preservation mandate, by sacrificing morality at the altar of Mammon.<br /><br />There is no on individual at fault here. Everybody is acting in the most professional; most moral way possible; given the fiduciary duties that they have to their clients and other stakeholders. It is the system of incentives and duties that drives us in the wrong direction; the evil is emergent, not designed; not deliberate."
