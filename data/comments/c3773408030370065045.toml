content = '''I&#39;ve structured my utility libraries such that when I get time, I will be able to do the vast majority of porting to various operating systems on a low-level. I have yet to solve the problem of &quot;all cross-platform GUI widget toolkits are absolutely terrible&quot;, however. This includes porting to mobile OSes or consoles. I have insisted for years that if you build a program, you should make it work on EVERYTHING, and I continue to work towards that goal (but it obviously isn&#39;t easy). The fact that people consider this to to be difficult is one of the problems I&#39;m trying to solve.'''
