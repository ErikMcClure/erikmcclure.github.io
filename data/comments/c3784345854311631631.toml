I mentioned ray-casting only because it was the most common algorithm originally used to approximate ray-tracing.<br /><br />Your article isn&#39;t clear about that, but Photon-mapping is not an approximation, nor an alternate algorithm - it is a refinement of one of the aspects of the ray-tracing model."
