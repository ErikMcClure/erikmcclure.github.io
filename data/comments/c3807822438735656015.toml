content = "You might have to trade a little of what you&#39;re passionate about for something that makes you money. I hear ya, it fucking sucks. Fuck playing the game, but we have no choice. <br /><br />We don&#39;t make the rules, we only play the game. Once you get good at the game, then you can influence the rules. Unfortunately the point system in this game is currently money. Sucks, but it is what it is. I do believe the world will be a hell of a lot different in 30 years though, so don&#39;t abandon all hope."
