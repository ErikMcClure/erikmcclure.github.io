content = "Bad code can be written in any language, of course. And a powerful language might even happily help you precisely express your bad ideas. <br /><br />But <a href=\"http://schneide.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/the-fallacy-of-the-right-tool/\" rel=\"nofollow\">languages are materials, not tools.</a> Programs have a maintenance cycle, and the original author might not be around to maintain it. We&#39;ll often want to extend programs, reuse them. Languages are also maintained - new optimizations, bugfixes, portability, updates to libraries. <br /><br />It is often reasonable to critique a program based on what language was used. But it is also quite reasonable to critique a program based on other qualities, such as end-user experience. Which qualities you&#39;ll weigh as most important probably depend on what you&#39;re doing with the program."
