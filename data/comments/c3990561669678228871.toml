content = "Define &quot;good software&quot;. Like @greenlyblue said, most software is like the &quot;car to go from A to B&quot;. Who cares if it&#39;s bloatware, if it does its purpose correctly. Even then, bugs are bound to happen with this enormous scale; bugs get fixed. <br />Visual Studio being slow? Get up to date, and have a ramdisk or SSD, or use a better alternative (unless you do C#). And submit a bug report.<br />Flat Design is horrible, vote with your wallet. <br />You happen to use bad/slow software? Switch to one of the dozens of alternatives.<br />Inexperienced developers write shitty stuff despite those fancy new languages designed to limit their crapware? News at 11.<br />Python/C++/C# etc are tools. For a task you should use the appropriate tool. Not go around doing everything with an electron microscope. <br />There&#39;s plenty of quality software nowadays, if you look around. Or took the first step to contributing in improving the functionality and correctness/optimisations of software: looking at opensource code. <br />Linux with GUI for basic functionality? KDE+mint. <br />Frontend and business software is not the place to look for stable excellent optimal designs. Look at middleware or systems code. <br />You&#39;re allowed to say whatever. But expand your horizons while thinking everyone is wrong. I prefer to assume everyone is wrong, look at things myself and from their perspective - and happen to either learn or teach interesting things.<br />Also, everyone would love if you can contribute with something to improve this &quot;situation&quot;. There are companies, where the produced software&#39;s footprint+correctness+speed are a huge factor, join them. Or contribute to some OSS. Or teach how to make &quot;good software&quot;, but back-up your claims with data there. <br /><br />The SW world isn&#39;t really that grim, it has actually improved a lot in the last two decades, in my experience.
