content = "If a program&#39;s functionality on a tablet is reduced in order to get it working on the tablet at all, how does that affect you at all as a console or PC gamer? The article clearly stated that the program would recognize what type of device it&#39;s running on and adapt itself accordingly, so playing a game on a console or PC, you wouldn&#39;t notice the &quot;reduced functionality&quot; of it being able to run on a tablet. And isn&#39;t it better to have the option to play it on a tablet perhaps not as comfortably as on other devices than to not have that option at all?"
