content = '''I don&#39;t disagree with you, but do a follow up. My view is that the current &#39;educational system&#39; has too broad a mandate. How can the any system offer equal opportunity to all while also adressing the &#39;needs&#39; of individuals. Seeing a problem is a first step, and since I believe that the answer to this particular problem is many solutions with narrower scope, every answer may be part of the solution. I&#39;d love to research and discuss the issue with you and post an alternative or opposing position whatever the case may be. '''
