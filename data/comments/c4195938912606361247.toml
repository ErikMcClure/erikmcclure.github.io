It hits on all of the points that I&#39;ve been reading and hearing lately about how our school system is not designed to create smart people, but rather worker bees -- people who do what they&#39;re told.<br /><br />I felt the same way as you all throughout school -- it wasn&#39;t challenging, I learned quickly to put in the minimum effort to get As so I could go about the rest of my life -- only going to class as necessary. Never had problems until grad school, and even then I just had to learn to manage my time differently. Now I work in a large corporate environment, and it feels like I&#39;m back in high school -- mandatory attendance, do what I&#39;m told (without feeling the full impact of anything I do), and nothing remotely challenging. I just come in and do what I&#39;m told each day.<br /><br />I&#39;d love it if we had an education system that encouraged creativity, entrepreneurialism, and independence -- at least for the individuals who are interested!"
