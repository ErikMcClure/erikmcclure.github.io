content = "Google has always let go of services that don&#39;t catch on. First they try a new service out and then they gather feedback and make changes. Once they feel they can no longer improve on such a service they let it go. It&#39;s too bad more companies didn&#39;t work this way. Also, ask yourselves why some of the brightest minds in tech work at Google? Most of them have made their fortunes and could move on but they choose to stay because of the environment Google offers it&#39;s employees/partners.  As far as taking away the 20% free time goes, X Lab is an area where the employees spend 100% of their time creating moonshot projects. Do you have any idea how much they spend on these moonshots? Most of the products and services that are created there will never produce a profit (so how does Google only focus on the bottom line and it&#39;s shareholders?). Another area that Google gets overlooked is how much non profit projects they are involved with. After reading the comments it&#39;s clear many of you need to do your homework before making statements. Google is unlike any other company in the world (public or private, tech or not). Listen to Larry Page speak at the annual Zeitgeist meeting and tell me they only care about profits. "
