I have seen too many awaken, from states like yours and worse, to believe it permanent.<br /><br />An ordinary programming job is not the stasis trap you fear it to be; more likely, it is a several-year detoured path out of the one you&#39;re in now. *However*, you should try to make it be one near San Francisco, New York, or Cambridge, and not one in Washington, as you are more likely to find community in these places.<br /><br />If you haven&#39;t tried the common chemical interventions (modafinil, choline, adderall), you should (but the last one only after all else has failed). Pay attention to your schedule density; changing the number of conversation hours per week from 0 to 10 to 20 to 40 has non-intuitive side-effects as big as many psychoactive drugs, not localized to the times when they&#39;re happening.
