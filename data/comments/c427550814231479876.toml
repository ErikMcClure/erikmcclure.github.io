content = "&gt; I just didn&#39;t tell people because they simply wouldn&#39;t <br />&gt; understand unless I explained how I was basically <br />&gt; insane by society&#39;s standards.<br /><br />I for one, think I understand what you are trying to express ( I can of course never be truly sure or experience what you are on the most fundamental level...but I feel like your use of language is very effective in at the very least making me feel like I understand exactly what you mean and relate to my own life.)  I also don&#39;t think you are insane by society&#39;s standard....society is large there are many of us, who are more like you that any of us could probably imagine.  I know that there are many many people that really dont seem to understand; I&#39;m almost convinced by now (29y) that some people must truly experience the phenomenon of life and consciousness in a fundamentally different way than me...I dont know..maybe we all do..maybe its just misunderstandings. <br /><br />Anyway...dont put yourself down by labeling yourself insane... maybe think of yourself more as excentric and brilliant (you dont need to brag about it...but its quite OK to think positive things about yourself.  I have a tendency to feel awkward or even bad about myself for thinking higly of myself in some way.  Modesty is a fine trait...but if we cant think positively about our traits or personality...how could we ever be happy or even remotely consider ourselves conscious. If we feel like were doing something bad, and we keep doing it, are unable to stop...its not always because were impotent...maybe we just have to admit that we really do like doing these things...that they are good things.  You dont sound like you are trying to hurt anyone else...as long as thats the case, I will cheer you on in pursuing your lofty or crazy ideas and goals.<br /><br /><br />&gt; I have plenty of employment options, but I fear <br />&gt; that once I go down that road there will be no <br />&gt; turning back I will miss out on a lot of amazing <br />&gt; stuff I could have done.<br /><br />I know this feeling very well.  And it is truly important to value your time and consider opportunity cost of any commitments you make.  But also think the of the opportunity cost you would have to bear by burning out, or being overcommited to one thing so much that your life becomes too unbalanced which can hinder you greatly in more effectively pursuing your dreams.  If you really really want to do great work, you have to accept that even though you love that work and it is all that matters to you, you may have to do things you dont like in the process of pursuing that work.  Whether thats taking on a job until your work can support you itself, or letting it go sometimes to let your brain calm down and recharge on creative energy.  Just like it&#39;s hard and frustrating to solve a specific programming problem, or find that bug sometimes, it&#39;s hard to muster the courage and discipline to make yourself do what you consciously decide to do.  None said it had to be easy...and honestly, if it was it would be pretty boring, no?<br /><br />It&#39;s crazy out there...im not sure we are or ever will be  capable of truly comprehending ourselves, our relationship or the rest of the cosmos.  And although we have a tendency to get irritated or disillusioned by things we cant do, sometimes we just have to let go and accept things, or at least allow us to come back later in order to take care of something else.  Dont let yourself get in the way of what you really want.  Follow what *you* think is the right thing to do.  I&#39;ve read many of your blog posts over the past years, and your graphics work is amazing and has thought me many things. <br /><br />"
