content = "Nice blog, btw.<br /><br />As an engineer, what really caught my attention was the fluid behavior in that demonstration. What exactly is going on under the hood of that? It did *look* incredibly realistic. <br /><br />I&#39;ve worked with actual simulations of fluid dynamics via the physics-based Navier Stokes equations, over finite volume grids and other discretization schemes, and doing that requires insane amounts of number crunching *for each timestep*.<br /><br />And yet, I&#39;ve seen fluid-ish fluid-like behavior produced via things like a bunch of squishy particles, etc. I&#39;m wondering if, even if it&#39;s not possible to tie it back to the physics, if for whatever reason the approximations you graphics guys are using capture enough of the right behavior to do things like lift/drag prediction far faster than the normal means of crunching PDEs.<br /><br />Anyway, just thinking out loud."
