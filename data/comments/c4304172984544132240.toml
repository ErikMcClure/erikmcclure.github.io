I did, occasionally, have some really good professors, like that TA I mentioned who sparked my love of mathematics, and one brutally difficult english class that had absolutely no standard &quot;tests&quot; of any sort (but I still managed to get a perfect 4.0 in that class because I actually remember how to do things other than take tests). However, the vast majority of it was just a sickening regurgitation of concepts, even in classes like comparative literature, where we were &quot;studying&quot; surrealistic art as an expression of creativity in the most un-creative way possible."
