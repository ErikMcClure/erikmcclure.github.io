At least, you hope it hits the camera. You see, to be perfectly accurate, you have to cast a bajillion rays of light out from the light sources and then see which ones end up hitting the camera at some point.&quot;<br /><br />I thought it was the other way around, i.e. raytracers cast rays from the virtual camera through the scene all the way back to the lights?"
