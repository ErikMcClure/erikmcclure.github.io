content = "It&#39;s very common (and easy) to mix up computer science and programming. The two are related, certainly, but they are not the same thing. Programming is writing computer programs. The definition of a programmer is an individual who writes computer programs. No more, and no less. <br /><br />Computer science is the theory of writing computer programs. And a background in CS can aid a programmer, but it is neither necessary nor required a successful or skillful computer programmer. Most programmers don&#39;t need to concern themselves with the details of all but the most basic algorithms and data types they use. They just need to know they exist and when they are appropriate. Actually implementing them themselves is usually re-inventing the wheel."
