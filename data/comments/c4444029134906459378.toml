content = '''Hear hear brother. I&#39;ve also thought about this problem and I think the fundamental problem is that software is a cost center when everything is run and managed by MBAs. If eBay for example could get rid of their entire Java stack and still remain a marketplace then they would do it in a heartbeat. eBay is in the business of markets and not in the business of making Java frameworks and so it doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that their Java is going to be a terrible mess. Other examples abound. Google is in the business of selling ads and making its CEO immortal and if they could do it all without their search infrastructure then like eBay they would do it in a heartbeat.<br /><br />As a technologist it upsets you but it shouldn&#39;t. Another analogy I can think of is cars. A car takes me from point A to point B and that&#39;s all a car is to me. If I could get from point A to point B by some other equally generic means then I would. So when a business is using technology they are using it in the same way I use my car.'''
