content = "You&#39;re missing the biggest reason why it&#39;s taught poorly:  Until children reach high school or thereabouts, they&#39;re being taught math by completely innumerate dumbasses, who, despite having years and years of repetition of the subject matter, have no better (and in many cases worse) understanding of the material than the kids they&#39;re teaching. <br /><br />These &quot;educators&quot; introduce hatred and fear of mathematics because of their own inadequacies, and -- as is typical of those suffering from Imposter Syndrome -- become aggressive and punitive when challenged about it.  My undergraduate degree was in mathematics, and in the honorary math fraternity meetings, my friends and I shared many stories of completely incompetent grade school &quot;math teachers.&quot;  <br /><br />I had several run-ins; my favorite was a sixth grade teacher who INSISTED that 6/0 = 0!  When in exasperation at her failure to understand the basic reasoning behind it, I showed her my older brother&#39;s algebra book -- which explained in detail why x/0 makes absolutely no sense -- she patronizingly informed me that, &quot;That&#39;s only true in algebra.  It isn&#39;t true with numbers. In this class it&#39;s 0.&quot;<br /><br />If you honestly think you&#39;re going to be able to get people with this level of conceptualization to teach anything that involves mathematical abstraction, you&#39;re living in a dream world."
