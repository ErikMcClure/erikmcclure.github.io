content = '''My working theory on this is that there is a large subset of people who believe deep down that things are fundamentally fixable. If something is not fixable it creates an uncomfortable feeling they have to resolve. They latch onto ideas as solutions because they can&#39;t accept there being no true solution.<br /><br />Telling such a person there is no perfect optimum won&#39;t resolve the issue. It will just make them angry because you&#39;re damaging their happiness. Their brain is disagreeing with reality at a basic level and you just can&#39;t fix that (baring hitting them on the head really hard). When life does shatter one of their illusions, they will generally just switch to a new belief.'''
