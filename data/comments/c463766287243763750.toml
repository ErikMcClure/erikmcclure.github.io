content = '''So basically there is no way to prolong it at all, not even by taking a few more courses in addition to your degree? Absolutely to leeway here at all? The reason why I ask is because I was able to take more classes after I had finished my program, and you may even be able to get a little extra time for health reasons, if you are stressed out, etc. Could by you a few extra months, unless there is absolutely nothing you can do here.<br /><br />I know this might be a little dishonest to your parents, but sometimes you have to think about yourself and do what&#39;s best for you, not your parents.'''
