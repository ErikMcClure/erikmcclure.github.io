content = "As a semi-interested follower of your Twitter, I&#39;m not worried for your prospects, because I felt that way before graduating college: &quot;I want to make a game maker but I also want to make a game and I want to immediately go indie and make something that I&#39;m happy with and will sell.&quot; (this was between 2003 and 2008) <br /><br />And at first I was going to just quit college with that plan halfway through but I was convinced to stay on...and I planned ahead and made a bunch of stuff before graduating. Nothing that I sold, and looking back on it it was kind of shitty in some ways, but - even though I wasn&#39;t building any edifice of code, and threw out a lot of stuff - it turned into the portfolio, which got me hired somewhere. Eventually, I left that job and worked on the &quot;magnum opus&quot; for about a year, and it completely, totally, wasn&#39;t. It twisted away from my dream at each turn, and emerged a skewed fragment of what I thought it would be. In doing this I learned how I had been lying to myself, and in exchange gained truth and wisdom about the world. The artist&#39;s greatest enemy, after all, tends to be themselves.<br /><br />You obviously have ideas and talent and can do some good work - which, assuming you&#39;re personable in RL, means you have many options for employment and it&#39;s just a matter of being *opinionated* about how you want to work and what type.<br /><br />It also means you have the foundation of doing great work - that&#39;s a &quot;necessary but not sufficient&quot; thing. Great work tends to mean &quot;life experience&quot; and &quot;purpose,&quot; and that brings me to the other point.<br /><br />The thing that you devote a lot of time to becomes the comfort zone by default, even if it involves &quot;hard work.&quot; So it doesn&#39;t matter what you worked on up to this point - if it&#39;s been a many-year effort, it&#39;s probably too comfortable and you have tunnel-vision. Assume that you will be wandering a bit in the future, making some path through the &quot;real world.&quot; Maybe you work on that old code some, or try to prove that the &quot;magnum opus&quot; works(and everyone should try), but you will also try new things - radically new things, things that you probably don&#39;t even know exist yet, in fields that you weren&#39;t aware of."
