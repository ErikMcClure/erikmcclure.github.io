content = "I will proclaim myself as the grande dame of this discussion.  I have been in the education system since the 1960&#39;s. I started school when I was 3 years old in 1964 and just finished a class in June.  I have taken classes at a the UW, various community colleges, self-study (remember when they used to call them correspondence courses?), online college courses, and professional training courses.   I happen to be very good at regurgitating information.  I am also a very creative person.  There are times when it&#39;s right to stick to the  facts and times when we should be thinking freely. My job does not support free thinking so I don&#39;t even go there.  But when I am talking about music, for instance, I think in terms of aesthetics and  interpretation.   One can compartmentalize these two modes of thinking and survive very well.  However, when the two come together, it&#39;s a beautiful thing.  Important contributions are attributable to those with the ability to combine facts and data with visionary thinking.  Is that what we call genius?  If so, will revamping the educational system create more geniuses?  I think not.  Geniuses are born, not created.  I don&#39;t like our current educational system, but I also think that most children and parents don&#39;t care.  Parents will go along with just about anything in exchange for the babysitting service. As far as secondary education goes, the best classes I&#39;ve taken are online college courses that cater to working adults.  These educators know that the students are not high school kids on their parents&#39; dime.  They are using their own money to get an education, so it had better be good.  These instructor-led online courses are the only classes I&#39;ve taken that have attempted to link the curriculum to actual application in everyday life.  Erik, I feel your frustration, but remember two things:  Sometimes there IS only one right answer, like the math solution in the back of the book.  The learning opportunity is in the path you carve out to get there; and free-thinkers will always be marginalized.  Your choices are to infiltrate the system and try to change it (like the Rookie Teacher), or work around it like you are currently doing.  You&#39;ll find a way and you&#39;ll learn a lot getting there.  Good luck!<br /><br />"
