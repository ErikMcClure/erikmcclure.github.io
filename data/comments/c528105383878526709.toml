content = '''We clearly have a different opinion on where to prioritize. Lets just sum up the differences and call it a day.<br /><br />1. Your engine uses multithreading that is easier to implement.<br />2. Your engine does not have a 1 frame (avg. ~8.3ms) lag for parsing input<br />3. Your engine will never cause physics artifacts (mine will sporadically have a render-artifact for one frame, most of the time not even visible depending on how hit boxes are created)<br /><br />1. My engine has a faster render loop (does not have to wait on anything, ever, even if physics or AI turned out to be really slow in a CPU heavy game)<br />2. My engine is able to run in any FPS I like without having to sacrifice determinism (important for RTS games)<br />3. My engine will not slow down the game and physics, even if we are rending at 2FPS (important for network games)<br /><br />Anything I forgot?<br /><br />Oh P.S. If you are really interested an low-latency rendering I recommend reading articles/interviews/... from John Carmack (creater of doom). He is is still actively developing and is by many people considered to be a God of game engine optimizations. He has a hobby for Virtual Reality, for which any input latency will make you puke.'''
