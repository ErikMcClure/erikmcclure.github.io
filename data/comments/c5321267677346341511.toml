The only reason a someone would call you out for daring to dream is someone who doesn&#39;t have or who has never had them.<br /><br />I spoke with a friend the other night concerning feelings over my unborn son.  Not many people can understand this, or how important it is to me.  Yes, he is a fictional character and yes, I get that.  Yes, I have personal flaws when it comes to him and yes, I&#39;m very much afraid to put him in a situation where pain might be delivered upon him.  But that&#39;s just me being protective.  Then again, I also have to realize that I can&#39;t nestle him so close all the time.  Yes, he makes me smile and laugh sometimes.  And the dreams I have of him are equally powerful.<br /><br />I think, what&#39;s more important for me is to have one chance, just one chance to tell him how much he mattered to me before he even existed.  Or maybe it&#39;s me just trying to imagine what it would be like giving him the things I never had.  Still, he&#39;s a dream worth fighting for, in as much as his name means."
