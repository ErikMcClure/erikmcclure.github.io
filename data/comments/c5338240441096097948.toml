content = "The second half of your post is something I&#39;d like to discuss a little more. To start I&#39;ll just say that (regarding derivatives for example), the &quot;df/dx versus f&#39;(x)&quot; thing essentially goes back to Leibniz vs Newton, while the other notations arose for various reasons: the &quot;dotted-variable&quot; notation is ONLY used to denote differentiation with respect to time (because this operation is just *so* common, e.g. in classical mechanics but really physics in general), while the other notations (Jacobian matrices, gradients, etc.) were likely invented to emphasize that multivariable functions were at play. To understand this, it usually suffices to study the relevant areas for a while. For example, if you learn some introductory Lagrangian mechanics you&#39;ll see just how useful it is to be able to write dots over certain things...<br /><br />If you look in old physics/engineering books you will see all sorts of weird stuff: people putting arrows over vectors, or typesetting them in bold face, etc. It also appears in lower-division math classes, likely because it&#39;s expected to lessen the cognitive load on novice students, specifically, by removing or at least diminishing their need to remember the *types* of the objects they&#39;re manipulating. However, the overwhelming majority of modern math books, at least pure math books, don&#39;t do this. They will write &quot;x&quot; without even batting an eye, whether x is a number, or a vector in R^n, a point on a manifold, or an element of some crazy Fr√©chet space or something. The expectation is that, for example, if I say &quot;Suppose x is in R^n&quot;, then technically you *have* been told that it&#39;s a vector, by virtue of it being an element of R^n, and you should not need to be reminded. This ties into the later part of your post: it is very true that mathematics has sprawled into an enormous tree. It&#39;s quite common, unfortunately, for two branches (even nearby branches!) to be mutually unintelligible. But I&#39;ve also grown to accept the present state of affairs since I genuinely believe that striving for absolute uniqueness in notation, as you seem to suggest, not only has diminishing returns, but is just straight up *impossible*. What are your thoughts?"
