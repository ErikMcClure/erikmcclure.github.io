content = "My entire point is that what we learn in school is becoming increasingly not useful. We *must* teach kids creativity in school because as computers become ubiquitous, the only useful tool we have as human beings is creativity itself. Everything else can and will be automated. When jobs or activities demand we know the material, we can just look it up on wikipedia. We don&#39;t need practice memorizing things anymore because we don&#39;t need to memorize anything. We have the internet. We need to learn to solve problems and apply creative thinking, not simply memorize reams of facts.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t think the current school system has a problem, you need to think about where we are headed in the future."
