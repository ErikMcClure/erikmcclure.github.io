content = "My graphics engine is required to run entirely by itself. I use box2D, which is an encapsulated physics engine. I therefore consider the division of labor to be fairly well enforced. However, I discovered that there is such a thing as *too much* encapsulation in that it really starts to get in the way of more practical solutions. Consequently there are a few places where I deliberately tie things together very closely because doing it any other way has a tendency to create more problems than it solves. CEGUI is a great example of trying to do too much with too much isolation of functionality, rendering it a bloated, catastrophic mess."
