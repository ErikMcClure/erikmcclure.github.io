content = '''Dude. I totally feel you. I&#39;m one of those people who always has a side project going. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve done for the past ten years. Always gotta have something else going, to keep the creativity flowing. Guess what? None of the projects I&#39;ve worked on I&#39;ve finished. Not a single one. Why? Because I&#39;ve always gotta start from scratch. I&#39;ve got to re-invent the wheel... because I want to know how the wheel works. I like to understand the insides. It&#39;s fair to say I love the process much, much more than the result. But the result impresses people. The result is what gets you noticed. So I&#39;ve been trying to find a project I can actually finish, too. Little things. And I&#39;m in the same boat -- even the little things I&#39;m having trouble finishing. Why? I think for me, it&#39;s that I can find minutiae even in the little things. I can find a reason to fail. I get stuck very, very easily. I want to make it perfect. I place the bar very high. I want what I produce to match perfectly what I have in my head. And I can think big. But I am just one person... with very little time... and a limited attention span. The longest project I worked on lasted three years. And it was a lot of fun... but it ultimately wasn&#39;t what I wanted to do.<br /><br />I think the challenge is just that -- finding something you really want to do, that&#39;s so worthwhile that you could work on it forever and still get joy out of it. <br /><br />So what is it you really want to do? What&#39;s a dream that&#39;s really worthwhile?'''
