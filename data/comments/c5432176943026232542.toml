There&#39;s pirating software for fun and then there&#39;s pirating software for a commercial venture and I find that immoral and I will not compromise my morals for something stupid like that.<br /><br />I&#39;ve adjusted my approach multiple times.

I have been trying to get better at drums but have made only incremental progress.'''
