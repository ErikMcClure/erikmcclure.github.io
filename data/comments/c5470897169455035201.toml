content = '''I&#39;d suggest something like the Harkness Method used at Phillips Exeter Academy. This is when 12 students are seated around an oval table designed so that everyone at every seat can see all the other students easily, and learning happens through discussion. The teacher is only a facilitator, who can sometimes step in to ask a specific question or push the discussion in a different direction. <br /><br />As a PEA student, I loved my classes -- especially my math classes. There was no textbook -- we solved word problems only, deriving complex theorems only to be told later what they were officially known as (Kepler&#39;s Laws for example).<br /><br />The problem is, I don&#39;t think this is feasible at a school like UW. It&#39;s a giant public school. It would be impossible to divide a school with over 30,000 students into small classrooms. More importantly, UW is strongly research focused, so many faculty don&#39;t consider teaching as a priority. All high school students applying to college should research those colleges -- and should know stuff like this before you enroll. There are other, much smaller schools which would be able to offer a creative thinking environment.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harkness_table '''
