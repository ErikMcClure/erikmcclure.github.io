content = "As somebody working to change educational systems through school leadership, I would agree that just rattling off random thoughts about how the system could get better without the background knowledge  would probably not be that effective (as you&#39;ve pointed out).  That said, what WOULD be very helpful to people like me and other educators actively trying to improve on a faulty system would be to start writing on concrete ways that we could TEACH MATH DIFFERENTLY.  I was a math teacher.  I taught it horribly for years until I realized that math was simply a tool for understanding abstractions - a &quot;tool that helps you do cool, useful things&quot; - and that changed how I teach.  That said, few math teachers actually have the depth of knowledge that you might have about the subject - and all the useful, creative pieces that exist - so if you could start posting thoughts on how we could teach math in a fundamentally different way . . . THAT would be helpful.  Because that&#39;s something individuals could implement in their own schools and classrooms, in spite of larger issues with the system.  <br /><br />So.  We have plenty of people making sweeping generalizations about &quot;improving education&quot; without doing the work, themselves, and that&#39;s great, but not always helpful.  What we do need, though, is more folks with real expertise focusing on specific chunks of the system that could be changed piece-meal without requiring sweeping, whole-level change.  Because those are the things that might legitimately gain traction and start to change how we think about and DO education - which is what it will take for change to take place.  Change is not impossible.  The system is entrenched and there is a lot working against us, but patience is necessary.  We have to begin enacting change in our thinking NOW, so that we can hope that a generation after us, the system is improved.  <br /><br />There are a lot of us trying to do things differently, but we don&#39;t even know what &quot;different&quot; could look like, half the time.  You seem to have some thoughts on what &quot;different&quot; could look like from a math teaching perspective, and we need to know what that would look like, so we can try to implement interesting, new ideas.  I, for one, would love to read that - and am in a position where I could actually push to implement it in real schools with real kids if it&#39;s realistically doable (and makes sense).  So - no need to veer out of your expertise to try to &quot;fix&quot; a system that&#39;s currently beyond your (or probably anybody&#39;s) current knowledge or abilities - just focus on what you ARE qualified to speak on, and try to make a real impact.
