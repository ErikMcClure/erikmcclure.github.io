content = "A couple comments/questions:<br /><br />When did you start programming?<br /><br />So you play music.. Do you write? Do you see yourself as creative in music?<br /><br /><br />Btw, if money is your issue (if you are scared that you will need to get a job to support yourself and then there will be &quot;no turning back&quot;), then I have a suggestion for you. I share the same worries. You can always do a little work on the side by yourself, if you are willing to learn some entrepreneurial/business skills."
