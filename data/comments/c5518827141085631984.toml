content = '''Some interesting points, especially the idea that Steve Jobs influence in Larry Page may have had a negative effect. <br /><br />What this and many other articles about Google fails to understand though is that there is no ONE Google. Every team there is run differently. Different priorities. Different culture. To talk out Google as if it is a single entity is just naive. Certainly some decision making is centralized but on the whole the company is full of many autonomous units. <br /><br />So when you talk about Google&#39;s decline, which Google are you referring to? Search doesn&#39;t seem to be declining at all. Neither Ads. Or Android. Maybe G+? '''
