content = '''Signed and unsigned integers don&#39;t mix; when used in an expression, the signed integer is treated as unsigned.<br /><br />Its almost impossible to find some code that isn&#39;t littered with legitimate signed integers.  They are really hard to avoid.<br /><br />Whereas the only place that unsigned creeps in is sizeof and size_t.  And even then ptrdiff_t and so on are signed.<br /><br />As a consequence, its a real shame that sizeof and size_t etc weren&#39;t signed and unsigned were banished.<br /><br />If you have to pick one, try living without signed.  On the other hand, you can easily live without unsigned.<br /><br />In Java bitwise arithmetic works fine despite normal maths being signed.  And there&#39;s no-one struggling to write anything for lack of unsigned integers.'''
