content = '''No. A lot of people like to take that out of this post (which is perhaps why it&#39;s so popular, since people seem to read whatever they want out of it), but I have gotten very good at pinpointing my objectives. I only started working on the GUI toolkit, for example, after a week of deliberation and a lot of &quot;Ok are you seriously going to do this, yes ok I&#39;m seriously going to do this because I can&#39;t fucking get fucking CEGUI to fucking work jesus christ&quot;. The problem I run into is that, despite having well defined goals that I carefully trim to something reasonable, they often just require a fuckton of time, and my initial attempts are usually broken in some way that requires me to go back and fix them.'''
