content = "I happen to like Python because it&#39;s the first computer language I really learned to use. I&#39;m a casual programmer, and Python is basically perfect for my needs.<br /><br />However I&#39;m not going to pretend that Python is perfect for the needs of anyone who isn&#39;t a casual programmer. All I&#39;ve used it for is to make automated character generators for various RPG systems. Including Mongoose Traveler. My job involves about as little programming as is humanly possible in a modern job, which means &quot;I fantasise about making small applications to improve my efficiency, then remember that HR doesn&#39;t want us touching the computer&#39;s programming because people got clever with them before I was hired and broke everything.&quot;<br /><br />So yeah. Also our computers all run windows 7, and we&#39;ve only just upgraded from XP."
