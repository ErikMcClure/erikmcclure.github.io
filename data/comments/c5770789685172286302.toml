content = '''I&#39;ve come across a lot of monitors that have almost a cut-off in bass response.  Have you tried just regular speakers with subwoofer? I often switch over to regular consumer speakers with subwoofer just to hear 80 hz and below.  That&#39;s tough though if you really can&#39;t hear it.<br /><br />Pascal (the producer guy who made chocolates for everyone in Dec and is coming in May) loves mixing bass though.  If you ever need a sound check, know you can also reach out him (he does this for a living).  Even his monitors almost seem to cut off at 80hz though, which is why I mentioned it might be monitors in general.'''
