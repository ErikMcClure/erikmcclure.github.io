content = "I am absolutely positive that is not the problem because for lower frequencies, I can FEEL the studio monitors producing bass, but it is completely inaudible to me. I can even lightly touch the speaker itself and feel it vibrating, but whatever tone it is producing is inaudible. Furthermore, the low frequency test that I use has precisely the same results between both my headphones and my studio monitors (tone becomes slightly audible at around 70 Hz at loud volumes, only becomes truly audible at 90 Hz). This makes it INCREDIBLY unlikely to be an equipment problem, unless both my studio monitors and my headphones have PRECISELY the same bass cutoff.<br /><br />I have also never been able to hear these tones under any circumstances, ever, no matter where I am or whose speakers I&#39;m using.<br /><br />At some point I may get a proper hearing test just to be sure, but I&#39;m very confidant in the results of my simple experiment here."
