title = '''Hi there! I just read your post and wanted to help...'''
content = '''Hi there! I just read your post and wanted to help; I&#39;m a PhD student in pure math so I can really relate to your struggles. Before I start, I&#39;d like to just say that all the equations you pulled from Wikipedia are in fact correct, all this stuff does make sense, and I hope to convince you below that the notation, once understood, is actually very efficient and precise. I would guess that your confusions mostly stem from poor instruction (e.g. professors placing too much emphasis on computations rather than defining things carefully). I&#39;ll just start from the top and work my way down, and then you can ask me if anything I say is unclear.<br /><br />Alright, so at the top you&#39;re discussing X, which you refer to as a &quot;distribution&quot;, but really, it is an object called a (discrete) random variable. Many courses will gloss over what exactly is meant by a random variable, and say something vague, like &quot;it&#39;s just some random numerical quantity&quot;. However, as the existence of your post shows, this can easily lead one into a swamp of confusion. So, here&#39;s the straight dope: a random variable is really a (measurable) *function*, X, from a *probability space* (what&#39;s this? see below), call it Ω, to the set of real numbers. Ignoring the &quot;measurable&quot; part (which is just a technical assumption), this means that X is a thingy which eats sample points (in other words, elements of the probability space Ω aka sample space), and spits out real numbers. For example, consider rolling two dice. The sample space here would be the set {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,1),(2,2),...,(6,5),(6,6)}, which of course has 6*6=36 elements. An example of a discrete random variable would be the function X that sends a sample point to the sum of the two values, so for example X((6,5)) would just be 6+5 = 11. In a book you would see them write &quot;Define a random variable X to be the sum of the two numbers rolled on the dice&quot;, or something. It&#39;s important to note that this is sort of misleading, because they&#39;re really defining X to be the sum NOT of two numbers, but of two random variables! (Which ones are they?) So there, now you know exactly what the X you&#39;re talking about above actually *is*.<br /><br />Above I should have also told you what &quot;probability space&quot; means. Well, it&#39;s basically a set, equipped with a &quot;probability measure&quot;: a way of assigning probabilities (numbers between 0 and 1) to certain subsets which people call &quot;events&quot;. Why only *certain* subsets you ask? Uhhh... this is a technicality and not really relevant to understanding things for now. It&#39;s because by invoking the Axiom of Choice and constructing some awful monsters, you can show that in a lot of natural scenarios you can&#39;t find a consistent notion of measure that works for *all* subsets. You can read more about this in any introductory treatment of the Lebesgue measure.'''
