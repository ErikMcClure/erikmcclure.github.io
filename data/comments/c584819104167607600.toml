It&#39;s more polished and has a much larger user community, thus you&#39;re likely to find someone who&#39;s run up against the same problem and posted it on the Ubuntu community forums.<br /><br />Additionally, in Linux, it&#39;s better to use the traditional tools (e.g.: Emacs) and it&#39;s actually far more productive to read the manual (or a good tutorial) _before_ one starts using the software.
