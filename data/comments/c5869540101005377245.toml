I intend to cover them by comparing them to C# delegates at a later point.<br /><br />As for why you don&#39;t see a &#39;T&#39; on the screen, it has nothing to do with function pointers - You are not thinking with the stack. You must remember that all functions are scopes. This is easy to remember because anything inside { } is a scope, and that includes a function. That means, like all other scopes, any variable declared on the stack inside a function ceases to exist outside of that function. Your code here is referencing a variable that no longer exists. You can&#39;t return a pointer to a variable declared on the stack inside a function because once the function exits, cstm[] no longer exists because it is now out of scope, so the pointer is pointing to garbage memory."
