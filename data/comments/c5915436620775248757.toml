There is a link to my Soundcloud over there in the sidebar which has a few of my completed songs and various ideas. My newgrounds profile (http://blackhole12.newgrounds.com/) has a more complete listing of the hundreds of songs I&#39;ve composed. I have sold a commercial album (which made me almost no money). Again, music is one of the few creative outlets I have, except it is almost always horrendously inadequate, as I described in the post."
