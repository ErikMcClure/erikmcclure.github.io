content = '''Question... are you doing all of this in C/C++? Have you considered this might be what is wearing you down?<br /><br />I gave up on C/C++ for hobby projects a long time ago. Now I mostly do WebGL in JavaScript. I get a free console, full introspection, and the ability to distribute it to thousands with one click of a mouse. <br /><br />C is a bureaucracy, C++ is Brazil. i find every time I&#39;ve used C++, it forces me into architectural decisions much too soon, and they are much harder to change afterwards.'''
