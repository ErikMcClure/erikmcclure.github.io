content = '''From my experience, it&#39;s hard IRL to distinguish the political sociopaths from the logical hardliners that are actually just sticking to principles by using &quot;that&#39;s probably&quot;, and not running others through a qualifier gamut in order to weasel out of a concrete answer.
