If you cannot create what you hear that is only because you aren&#39;t that good at turning your thoughts into music. Long-term, I would suggest picking a musical instrument (guitar or synthesizer). When you are creating music the way you are doing it is EXTREMELY hard to capture what is flowing through your mind. When you can play an instrument competently then you can quickly play whatever comes to your mind. An instrument is key I think. You apparently have the creative imagination for music, you just need to translate that through your fingers."
