As a biology / biochem major I didn&#39;t have the concentration of math that you did, but I did experience the standard calculus series (taught from the &quot;Koblitz notes&quot; at the time I believe) which consisted of a prof reading and writing these notes in front of a class verbatim. This was terrible teaching and student suffering was palpable. I only saw the light when I had to retake one of these calc classes in the summer, from a grad student who was allowed special privileges to teach from notes he developed on his own. This special grad student wore all blue clothing and published his notes on blue paper. We called him the blue guy and he was truly fantastic! All applied math, with tons of discussion and examples. That &#39;blue guy&#39; rekindled my interest in math AND taught with overt passion for the topic he clearly lived for. Terrific!<br /><br />In contrast to the staid standard calculus series, most of the rest of my UW experience was fantastic, and I wonder why you didn&#39;t seek out interesting and challenging opportunities yourself. One quarter I took a class (1/3 undergrads, 1/3 grads, 1/3 profs) to develop the plan and degree framework for reintroducing a department that had been mothballed decades earlier; no scripted moments or scan-trons there! Got a lot out of teaching skiing with Husky Winter Sports (not for credit, but for the fantastic experience, fun and resume fodder.) Lab classes in the sciences certainly had some element of reaching expected conclusions, but originality, perspective and exploration weren&#39;t actively discouraged. Similarly, courses that required summarizing and presenting published research articles to small groups were a fantastic insight into &#39;real&#39; science for an undergrad, and had no script or expectations. For-credit research in actual labs was also a great option for undergrads that provided real world experience and all-application all-the-time. Another nice option for exploring careers and gaining experience was a program that paired undergrads with a grad student or working scientist, and placed them in a high school class to teach hands on labs. This was an awesome, eye-opening experience where I was able to see the massive difference between a resource poor West Seattle HS science class (one electrical receptacle per room, few students anticipated college) vs Eastside HS classes (abundant resources and the inevitability of college.) So much opportunity.<br /><br />I got a ton out of my time at UW and I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t. Your degree focus was different of course. But, that&#39;s not the only factor that defines a stint a college, anymore than placement in a department or workgroup in a professional setting necessarily defines your scope and experience in that environment. As I read your comments, it is clear that you intentionally opted out of a college experience, inside and outside the classroom. Had you turned up in a language, history or science department and indicated you wanted to apply you math skills in order to get more out of your time at school, I can only imagine you would have found a plethora of opportunities. Sure, the calc instruction may be abysmal. But, that&#39;s a far cry from legitimately generalizing the whole institution as broken. <br /><br />Education will evolve with Coursera, Khan Academy, etc and universities will have some growing pains / contraction as free education resources proliferate. But, I&#39;m certain there&#39;s still a place for applied / hands-on learning and that universities will continue to fulfill this need for years to come. "
