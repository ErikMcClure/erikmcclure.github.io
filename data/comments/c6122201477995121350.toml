content = '''My main comment is below but I wanted to cut and paste it here so I can tell you something very important: please read this( and thr linked pages within): http://lesswrong.com/lw/c3/the_sin_of_underconfidence/ . You DO know something so you ARE justified in being confident about your ideas, don&#39;t be afraid to present them. Yes you are going to be wrong and naive about this and that but a guarantee anything you can spit out will be a whole much less crappy than the current system.<br /><br /><br />Great post, but I&#39;m finding myself understanding a lot about what&#39;s wrong and not a lot about what should be done instead. I have read that Mathematicians Lament PDF that you probably know about and came out with the idea that math is the &quot;art of ideas&quot; which summaries some kind of warm fuzzy feeling, but even with his and your writing, if some one asks me &quot;alright, why is math great then?&quot; I&#39;d be startled and not know what to say. I have a few minor things like explaining that &quot;X is made of waves&quot; is confused, since to say something is a wave is a purely mathematical statement about X&#39;s behaviour, but it&#39;s not much on it&#39;s own. So could you please provide some examples of ways to improve the system, or perhaps make that blog post anyway, since it would be valuable to me in my efforts to &quot;enlighten&quot; my friends. Don&#39;t just give up because you can&#39;t fix everything at once. enlightening 100 readers so that they can go through life with and passing on these understanding. It&#39;s easy to rant, but hard to step up and lay out a series of improvements, so do it if you can! What&#39;s trivial to you others are obvlivlious to.'''
