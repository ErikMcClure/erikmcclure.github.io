content = '''I don&#39;t see the Win8 UI in that black&#39;n&#39;white manner.<br /><br />What I think MS is doing, is that they correctly take advantage of the situation that in the current market it is expected to come up with a new user experience which fits mobile devices such as tablets, and that&#39;s what the Metro UI is for.<br /><br />But, MS has always valued backwards compatibility very high, so they keep supporting the old desktop UI for users who continue to use a desktop computer, are used to the traditional desktop PC experience, or just need to use legacy programs.<br /><br />For those users, there is no point to try forcibly make some mis-matched &quot;transition&quot; with the new UI. It is just reasonable to keep the &quot;old&quot; desktop stuff as is, to make as smooth as possible experience for backwards compatibility, and let the newer UI live on the side for apps designed for that.<br /><br />The backwards compatibility thing is a nice aspect of Windows. I&#39;ve lately started appreciating it a lot more, when I have realized how eagerly some device-hw or OS vendors deprecate their stuff, making things obsolete the minute you carry them out from the store.<br /><br />Sometimes I feel this even extends to the software side (APIs), where stuff can get deprecated faster than a developer buys new socks, basically needing rewrite/re-port of stuff every 1-2 years!'''
