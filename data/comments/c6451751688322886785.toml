content = "Interesting view on our world although it sounds a bit depressing from time to time. ;-)<br />Your way of seeing the world as a programmer might seem very strange to many people because they are not able to really understand it. It&#39;s the same for other artists; take an (abstract) painter for instance, he paints images many people just don&#39;t understand what&#39;s about but from his view is a way to express his view on the world. The same thing applies to music, music is something one can not express in another way.<br />On the other hand we don&#39;t live (yet) in a world where only our self, our dreams and our creativity is in the focus but we live in community where we have to make sacrafices and get out of our comfort zone to keep connect to other people, to satisfy the dreams/will of other people to get some money to survive. Sometimes we&#39;re more free in the way we want to work on such tasks and sometimes we get strict limitations. Sometimes the limitations seem logical to use and easy to follow but sometimes they just seem utterly stupid and need a lot of will and work to get done.<br />To get a bit more concrete coding standards are often a pain but are nessecary to keep a clean codebase. This is a thing that has been proven over and over and over again. If a team of programmer can do whatever they want, implement things they&#39;ve always dreamed of then the product will soon get a big pile of messy code. Of course there are situation where so much freedom didn&#39;t bring any harm but I&#39;d say such developers had their own untold standards. ;-)<br /><br />Chasing after our dreams is one of the main drivers of humanity but we&#39;ll only reach such a state in a perfect Utopia and from my realistic view this will never gonna happen, except maybe in a Matrix like scenario where everything is simulated. :-)"
