That is NOT the problem. The problem is the sound design, synth design, and quality of samples I have to work with. It&#39;s hard to write orchestral music without a decent orchestra sample library, all of which costs hundreds of dollars. I have gotten extremely adept at recreating the melodies I hear in my head. The problem is that the digital instruments I have available to me are woefully inadequate."
