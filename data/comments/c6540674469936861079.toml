The CIO at a large computer company that contains the letters H and P made an internal statement at the end of 2010 that the employees are &#39;fungible resources&#39; and should be able and ready to move from one project/team to another as needed for the good of the company.  This seems like a good idea when you consider that everyone writing code was labeled as a programmer/Engineer I,II,III,IV,V or whatever.  This may make sense when labeling for payscales in HR, but when there is a person with 10+ years of web coding experience being asked to use C after those many years, that fungibility tends to not apply.<br /><br />The big question is how do we define the different &#39;practices&#39; or &#39;specialties&#39;, and if we do that, how do we handle those who work for a smaller company where they actually DO get to work with many different technologies?"
