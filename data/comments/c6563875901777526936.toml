content = "It&#39;s a very hard thing to have to accept limitations.  Sometimes limitations are due to not knowing enough, other times it&#39;s due to not being good enough.  Anyone can come up with an idea -- see your quote above -- but turning that idea into *something* is very, very hard work.  It takes maybe two hours to watch a movie, for instance, but that movie could have taken *ten years* to get to the screen, from original idea to finished product.  It could have taken five years to just perfect the script.  Then two to three years to arrange production and then film it.<br /><br />Also, it helps to learn when to say No to yourself.  I understand completely the dendritic nature of ideas, how if X, then Y, and then also Z.  How things connect is very compelling by itself.  But if you aren&#39;t finishing X first, you shouldn&#39;t move onto Y and Z.  And yes, once X is finished and you move to Y, you&#39;ll have more experience and knowledge that could lead to a revision of X, but at least you will have X finished and have something to revise.  And if circumstances conspire to prevent you moving to Y, you at least have a *finished* X and that&#39;s a start.  Again, good luck.  I hope my spew of words have helped in some small measure."
