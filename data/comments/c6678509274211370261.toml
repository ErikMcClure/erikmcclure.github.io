content = "Hooray - exactly right, although I&#39;d make two additions:<br /><br />Trig identities are another example, not a exception to your point: sin² + cos² = 1 and Euler&#39;s identity provide all of the standard trig identities with a little algebra and no memorization.  Understanding trig in terms of geometry on the unit circle also gives a whole different understanding, and brings some fun back into trigonometry.<br /><br />- The extension I get is that the purpose of mathematics is logical thinking and solving puzzles *not* memorization.  If math is being taught &quot;by formula&quot; it is a complete miss, not of interest to anyone except standardized test takers and over-competitive academics.  If we taught by puzzle and by problem there would be more love in the topic, and more thinking in the rest of the academic world."
