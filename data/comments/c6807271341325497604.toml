content = "Recently, I think there&#39;s some mathematical reawakening amongst the engineering majors (myself included). It always excite me to see how other engineering majors view pure math, since on the outside, they seem like the opposite end of the spectrum. The two opposing views are: the majority &quot;pure math is useless and I don&#39;t care about it&quot;, and the minority &quot;I am finding myself drawn toward this seemingly useless endeavor because it&#39;s so logically beautiful and God help me apply this to the messy world we live in.&quot; The minority are probably people who wound up in a pure math class because they got too curious (myself included).<br /><br />Very refreshing read and I look forward see more of your views! /)"
