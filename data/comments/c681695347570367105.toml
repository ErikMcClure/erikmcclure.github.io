content = "And this is why I&#39;m a wanted sub at my preferred middle school.   Instead of just writing out a math problem and solving in what I would consider to be a simple way, I actually break down the equation, piece by piece, and teach the kids what each piece is and how it works.  Funny thing is, it doesn&#39;t just work for math -- it&#39;s for anything.  And this is also why, as future history teacher, I will not be pulling out the multiple choice tests.  The only thing multiple choice teaches is process of elimination.  That works just fine for a pop quiz.  I will be giving out essay tests, which will not only permit students to think about the problem creatively and critically, but they will also be able to _choose_ which examples best illustrate the question, based on their own interpretation of the reading.  My goal is... the answer doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be the &quot;right&quot; one.  Did the student get the concept?<br /><br />Recess is fundamental.  These days, it&#39;s practically the only time of day where the kids get to go outside and legitimately enjoy it.  That said, I don&#39;t think the usual fifteen minutes is enough time.  I think the kids need at least a half hour (attached to lunch), with a fifteen minute rest period in between two morning and two afternoon classes.<br /><br />In today&#39;s world, we need to be teaching our kids the importance of work/life balance.  Leisure time is just as important, if not more important, than time spent doing work.  Life is intended to be enjoyed, not the other way around.  If you consider for a moment that in the history of our civilization, there have been whole classes of people in every society who are simply disposable.  They do the work that no one else wants to do, just because it&#39;s too difficult or dangerous.  And you know something?  That really doesn&#39;t speak to anyone&#39;s value as a human being.  We really are judged in this life by how we treat others, and to deny a person the only thing they have in their formative years -- POTENTIAL -- really is a crime against humanity.<br /><br />Throwing standardized tests at our kids only proves one thing -- they&#39;re good at taking tests.  Well, what about the kid who isn&#39;t good at taking tests?  What if that kid is good at being creative, inventive, or innovative?  It does not assist in memory, recollection, absorption, creativity, or shed any distinctive light on potential.  And just think about the value of that child&#39;s education and then his or her value as a person."
