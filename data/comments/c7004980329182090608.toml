content = '''Hey Erik,<br /><br />I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve written this. I have just recently graduated from a university in UK with a BSc in Computer Science and I was working on a blog entry that was pretty much saying the same stuff you&#39;ve mentioned here; except, I&#39;m not a terrific writer and it wasn&#39;t coming along smoothly.<br />I&#39;m now putting my thoughts together on what a solution might look like (for higher education) from a very abstract point of view. But the scale of the problem, in my mind, is astronomically large. The solutions needs to dig deep and go all the way down to kindergarten level. It needs lots of money and great people.<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#39;d be interested to discuss the problem/solution-space if you&#39;re ever up for it.'''
