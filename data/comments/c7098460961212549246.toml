content = "For tools development in general I&#39;d say it&#39;s best to bootstrap to launch then if there is uptake consider outside funding for expansion. The parties.. Whatever.. My facility is right across from Hipstamatic and I saw their quick rise / fall albeit from across the street; if I had to define brogrammer seemingly that shoe fits. ;P All the parties are pointless for the most part.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t exactly want to peg my family above as not being supportive entirely; it mostly comes down to just a different approach that is not familiar to them; IE individual entrepreneurship / lack of knowledge about the tech scene, etc. I perhaps painted it too bleak above, but yeah there can be challenges.<br /><br />I definitely want to be supportive and say go for it from the engine / tools angle. You&#39;ve already probably learned a lot and will learn a ton more. I&#39;ve always liked Josh Bloch&#39;s sentiment that &quot;API design is a noble and rewarding craft&quot;..<br /><br />On general advice regarding getting a job.. I suppose the number one golden rule is to know what you are worth and demand it. This seems obvious, but a lot of engineers seemingly don&#39;t do this. Where one falls in the first couple of years may require just feeling that out.. However, someone like yourself who is passionate about tech and works on projects independently is valuable in the near and long term. <br /><br />I lucked out because after a year of working at a startup years ago where I busted my tail I left and they essentially begged for me to come back 6 months later and that allowed me to kick start my contracting career which has funded the last 6 years w/ several periods where I&#39;ve had a 6+ months to a year to work full time on original tech / engines. I unfortunately got stuck w/ a day job for the last year after a big corp contract negotiation fell through just before inking the deal. doh.. them the breaks..<br /><br />In general it&#39;s harder to run a contracting business when one is doing R&amp;D / intense tech work between contracts vs being out and about networking and lining up followup contracts, so that is something to keep in mind if you start contracting and pursue your own projects at the same time.<br /><br />Well.. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to keep your head down.. The existential change / rage / unknown next steps will work themselves out. Having a will to create and more so acknowledging that it is not going to dissipate is handy."
