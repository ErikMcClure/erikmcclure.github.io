content = '''I am hesitant about publishing my alternative ideas precisely because I haven&#39;t had time to develop them as much as I&#39;d like. I&#39;m not confidant that they will work, they&#39;re just directions to investigate. You have already brought up many of the things that I would suggest, but I don&#39;t have a single coherent solution, because I don&#39;t have the experience necessary to figure it out. It&#39;s a really big problem, and I don&#39;t think I could solve it myself.'''
