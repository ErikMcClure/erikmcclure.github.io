content = '''I think creative thinking is important. When you are thinking creatively you are thinking about ideas that you haven&#39;t really thought of before. You may have considered it briefly in the past, but you didn&#39;t really getting into it.<br /><br />When you are thinking about ideas that you haven&#39;t thought of before you can begin to question what you are doing and if it provides any value. If this leads to realizations that cause a paradigm shift it can help you to begin analyzing your situation and hopefully trying to think of a way to get out of that situation.<br /><br />From what I&#39;ve been able to see anecdotally is that lots of people do think creatively, and may even sense that there might be a problem, but the solutions seem too far out of reach. They are &quot;stuck&quot; because they feel that they can&#39;t change the things that they think need to be changed.<br /><br />This lack of belief in your ability to affect the world in ways that you would like can leave you in a situation where you will just accept whatever is told to you. You have no real choice. At least from a certain perspective.'''
