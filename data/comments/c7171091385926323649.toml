content = "I usually hear the PC gamers belittling the people with consoles, so not sure where you&#39;re getting the other end from.<br /><br />I think it comes down to games and natural input methods, and then preference: if you like RTS and FPS, PC&#39;s keyboard and mouse standard will suit you a lot better than a console&#39;s controller tends to, because developers know how to design well for that. Few to zero console RTS games have handled well enough for their audience to be happy.<br /><br />Alternatively, simplified controls make consoles a bit easier to pick up on, imo, but I&#39;ve been playing them my whole life, and only recently gotten into PC games at all. For me it comes down to &quot;is the control scheme preferable one way or the other?&quot; and &quot;do I need to upgrade hardware to play the stupid thing?&quot;"
