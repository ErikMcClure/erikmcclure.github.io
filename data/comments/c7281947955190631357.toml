content = '''Hoi Erik,<br /><br />I have a similar problem; I typically get bogged down at the mathematical formulation of a superproblem to my own, because if I just solve the more general problem then I get the subproblem that I&#39;m working on as a &#39;freebie&#39;. So for example:<br /><br />1. Start building a calendar application. And I *do* try to cut it down. As I start out, it&#39;s just for me, I don&#39;t need to solve the problem of many users or intuitive editing, it can just store unsanitized HTML at this point. I won&#39;t even use a language that I really like; I&#39;ll just use PHP because it&#39;s simple.<br />2.  But that calendar application requires a good way to send messages back and forth! Okay, JSON on the backend because I don&#39;t want to write a parser -- a parser would lock me into PHP more than I want. But the messages still need to be syntactically valid, so I&#39;ll want a language for writing schemas. JSONSchema exists, but is ugly.<br />3. On the train to my Oma&#39;s birthday, I come up with a self-describing language -- in fact, ultra-simple self-describing languages -- for sending such messages, as based on using JSON like an S-expression. The fact that it can validate itself is pretty exciting, the fact that it&#39;s much less abstract than JSON Schema is also exciting.<br />4. It occurs to me that it looks ugly because it&#39;s in JSON, and there is a better language based on unary operators and associative function compositions alone which better serializes &#39;type&#39; information and looks prettier. On the train ride back I prototype this new programming language. <br />5. All of that effort comes to nothing because honestly, I don&#39;t want to be writing a new parse-tree-language for this problem.<br /><br />It&#39;s all a compromise, productivity vs. awesome, and I feel like it crushes me sometimes to have to choose against so much awesome when I want to be productive. Ira Glass talks about some similar concerns in creative professions in his talks on storytelling: <br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loxJ3FtCJJA<br /><br />We could establish a room on IRC (maybe FreeNode #crazyprojects or so), where we can all get together regularly and discuss these sorts of things? The real thing we&#39;d need to establish is an open invitation to any friends-of-friends who get caught up in such crazy projects to swing by and talk about them.'''
