content = '''Because they&#39;re teaching it wrong – most likely! It’s a given that Math could be tough and complicated. I think the flaw here is with teachers implementing a single and general method of teaching to all of their students, without considering the learning preference and difference may vary. Some students will be ready to take Algebra lessons as soon as they learn arithmetic, while it may take more time and practice for some.
