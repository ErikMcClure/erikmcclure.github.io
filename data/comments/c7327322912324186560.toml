content = "I graduated high school never going past algebra. I took pre-cal in college, never went further than that.  I&#39;d like to understand math, but it frustrated and angered me, so I don&#39;t get it.  As Erik said, the teaching is the main reason why.  There&#39;s a load of more stuff I could do with programming, automotive applications, and firearm design if I understood math any more than 2+2=4, but all during my education my time was wasted learning how to do stupid triangles and whatever the hell those things are where you have (x + 1 + 5)(x+5) or some fucking useless bullshit like that."
