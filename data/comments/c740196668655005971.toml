content = "By &quot;doesn&#39;t solve&quot; I meant that raytracing, BY ITSELF, does NOT solve photorealism - and it doesn&#39;t, you need better materials no matter how fast your raytracing is, and if you consider better materials as part of raytracing, you are over-extending the term &quot;raytracing&quot;. Of course, you the proceed to say that *I* am overextending the word &quot;photorealistic&quot;, but what I&#39;m trying to do is point out that &quot;photorealism&quot; is actually *more* subjective than most people think. If you don&#39;t think this, good for you.<br /><br />If you think I am going into too much detail you simply don&#39;t realize how much those details contribute to the experience. I&#39;m sure someone would have said the same thing about parallax mapping and relief mapping years ago."
