content = '''Moving on, you say that &quot;E[X]&quot; (which, yes, is the same thing as &quot;E(X)&quot; -- mathematics is done by humans after all, and for better or worse there will always be such minor variations among people&#39;s notational preferences) is bad notation. Actually, it&#39;s fine though: I mean, at the end of the day it *is* just a notation and nothing more, but you can roughly think about E[-] as being some kind of function that consumes *random variables*, and produces a real number as output (called the &quot;expectation&quot;, &quot;expected value&quot;, or, indeed, also the &quot;mean&quot; of the r.v.). Thus, even though X does not &quot;equal x_i&quot;, as you say, those numbers p(x_i) *are* part of the data packaged into X. [How? Well, the domain Ω of X is a probability space, which means it comes equipped with a gadget called a &quot;probability measure&quot;, P, that allows us to decide how &quot;large&quot; subsets of Ω are. Thus, p(x_i) just means P({w in Ω such that X(w) = x_i}), or in words, it&#39;s the probability that an outcome occurs to which X assigns the numerical value x_i. Remember what I said above about X being a function from Ω to the reals.] <br /><br />OK, next you say E[X^2] isn&#39;t actually equal to (E[X])^2. This is true, and it&#39;s good, because otherwise the variance would always give zero! To understand what the notation &quot;E[X^2]&quot; means, note that X^2 is a *new* random variable. Rigorously (going back to our definition of random variables as functions), it is the *composition* of the function X : Ω-&gt;R with the squaring map g : R-&gt;R, that is, X^2 = g circle X, as a function. Intuitively, you can think of X^2 like this: to get the probability that X^2=x for some x, you basically just find the probabilities that X=+sqrt(x) and X=-sqrt(x), and add &#39;em together. Pretty natural, right? The same reasoning applies to XY: it is a *new* discrete random variable, and to find out the probability that, say, XY=10, you have to say &quot;hmm, well if X and Y both take on positive integer values, how could we possibly have XY=10? well, we could have X=1 and Y=10, or X=2 and Y=5, or X=5 and Y=2, or X=10 and Y=1&quot;... and then add up all those probabilities! (Note that saying things like &quot;X=1&quot; is teeechnically abusive, because X is NOT a number -- it&#39;s a random variable, i.e. one of these &quot;measurable functions&quot;, and functions can never equal numbers; it&#39;s a type mismatch -- but people do this all the time because it&#39;s more intuitive to think of these as &quot;realizations&quot; of a random variable than the rigorous way, which would be writing the awful eyesore P({w in Ω : X(w)Y(w) = 10}) in place of Pr(XY=10).)<br /><br />Again, hope I didn&#39;t just confuse you with all this. Please let me know if anything is unclear, I&#39;d be glad to help more.'''
