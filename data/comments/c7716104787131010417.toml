content = '''Hi Erik. Kind of late to reply, just wanted to share two thoughts after reading. The first is that your argument here is weak. The issue you&#39;ve identified isn&#39;t one of signed vs. unsigned, it&#39;s one of overflow errors. Many implementations of the binary search algorithm were (and some still are) broken because they have low and high declared as (signed or unsigned, doesn&#39;t matter) integers and compute (low + high) / 2 for the midpoint instead of low + (high - low) / 2. Using unsigned vs. signed may save you from the abs() problem but doesn&#39;t save you from other overflow problems that are just as likely to happen if you&#39;re dealing with numbers near the limits. The solution of course is to defensively code by strictly filtering foreign input or asserting boundaries or using data types guaranteed not to overflow.<br /><br />My second thought is more on why unsigned is important but not so much for integers. Java 8 is -finally- adding support for unsigned integers, it&#39;s about time. That particular defect of forbidding unsigned was unnecessary, just like forbidding multiple inheritance that resolves conflicts by parent-order like Python does. Anyway, the reason having unsigned is important is because unsigned integers are a natural and efficient way to construct many algorithms and data types that work on bit strings with no concept of type. If you have to use signed integers as a basis the code quickly becomes slow, complicated, unwieldy, and stupidly difficult to maintain and reason about because suddenly particular bits in the bit strings are special under certain operations, and compilers will end up generating a lot of inefficient code.'''
