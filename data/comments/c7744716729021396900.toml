content = "I can understand how you feel. But I disagree with you. Google is not at all declining. Its evolving.<br /><br />I, like you, adore Google. I love the company and what it has done over the years with its power of technology and gave us so many brilliant products. But the truth of running a company is that you need money. And running a business, involves not only listening to your heart but also to your investors and other stakeholders. And at the end, whatever decision you make, you make it for the betterment of the company and for a better future.<br /><br />Google still contributes to the open source. Google has revolutionized the web, the mobile industry and now with Google X, they are solving more difficult problems than ever before. I believe one of the reasons to form Google X was to continue innovating without thinking of the business perspectives. You can say that the Google X is the new Google. But the products which will come out of it will not only solve problems but will also help Google earn more money which in turn help Google take on more challenges. You see, its a cycle.<br /><br />I have high hopes of Google. With their computing power and resources, they can truly have a great impact on the world."
