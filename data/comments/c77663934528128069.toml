content = "I am ranting. This is a rant. In rants, you yell about things that you hate. I apologize if &quot;yelling about things I hate&quot; was somehow mistranslated into &quot;immature victimization&quot; because nowhere do I even imply I give a flying fuck about what happened to ME, only the various ways Microsoft was a complete disaster through my own experiences. I was simply stating what happened and noting how unbelievably badly this reflected on Microsoft from my own comically not-objective viewpoint. It&#39;s supposed to be a peek into how Microsoft operated back in 2008, preferably in an amusing way, but apparently you were born without a sense of humor, and I can assure you I feel very sorry for you and might even donate to the Incapable-Of-Laughing charity for your sake."
