content = "i don&#39;t think the ed. system is failing anyone, it&#39;s perfectly fit for this world. its primary goal is provide companies and the government with suitably trained workforce. in a money-based economy knowing a bunch of formulae and dry facts and being able to effectively follow instructions - which is precisely what the system is teaching us - oftentimes is more valuable than understanding essentials and being able to tackle problems you haven&#39;t been trained to solve. to make money you need to understand existing routines - so that you can see business opportunities you can exploit - and be able to adapt to new ones so that you can stay afloat as the market evolves. this is true for both employers and employees (well, at least that&#39;s how i see it). pure technological innovation isn&#39;t valued: look at the valley - although it&#39;s often presented as a center of innovation this is only half true - it&#39;s a center of *financial* innovation, the valley people are constantly creating new way to turn technology into money. this approach results in mutilated technology and awful designs but it doesn&#39;t matter as long as it helps make money. besides, half-assed products that don&#39;t fully solve the problems they are intended to solve create new business opportunities for those who want to solve artificial secondary problems such products create. if the ed system was about creativity and people who go through it dedicated their lives to creating sound designs that help make actual problems go away we would be living in an idea-based economy that values beauty, elegance and effectiveness of solutions. unfortunately there aren&#39;t that many people out there who are fit for this line of work. you can train a person to follow a pattern but you can&#39;t train someone to be creative. you can engage people in some creativity inspiring projects but most of them will stick around only for as long as it provides entertainment. following instructions is way simpler, gives immediate reward, provides a sense of purpose. maybe there are even some physiological differences that turn most people into consumers rather than creators. so i can understand why the educational system is the way it is - it serves the needs of the majority. the actual problem is that those in the creative minority don&#39;t put enough effort into creating a separate environment for creative kids and adults. i hear a lot of whining but not much beyond that.<br /><br />btw. here&#39;s an blog post similar to yours but from the pov of a mathematician: http://jeremykun.com/2013/11/04/deconstructing-the-common-core-mathematical-standard/"
