content = '''Imo, creativity and drive are the most important things. If you are creative and you keep going you will make it.<br /><br />I was never that good at the technical side, and even now I find it a struggle. I am, however extremely creative. Anyone can get through the technical side if they dig long enough, not anyone can acquire creativity. You&#39;re lucky.<br /><br />I can&#39;t remember what the statistic is but I think like 95% of kids under the age of 5 have genius-level creative-IQ&#39;s, and that decreases with age.<br /><br />Creativity seems to be something that you are born with, and the question is if you can keep it or not. The other side, logic, math, etc. gets better the longer you work at it. If you have managed to hold onto your creativity then you should feel relieved that you still have the opportunity.<br /><br />Keep hammering, you will break through eventually. You might just have to work a little smarter, not harder. Programming is hard, being perfect is harder.'''
