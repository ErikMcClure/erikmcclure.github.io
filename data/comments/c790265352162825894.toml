content = "Hi there.<br />If you want to make more money with your music, you should probably think about you markteting strategy. There are so many tools you can use to download from youtube or bandcamp for free. People will rather use them instead of supporting you...<br />If I already had my own bank account I&#39;d totally buy the Solar Noise - Ep album (I&#39;m only 15), because you Sir are one of best music artists ever. And I know you can&#39;t even buy a sandwich for that...<br />I can only wish you the best of luck and hope you won&#39;t give up on your dreams.<br /><br />Merry Christmas<br />(and sorry for my bad school english. Im still learning it)<br />Janie"
