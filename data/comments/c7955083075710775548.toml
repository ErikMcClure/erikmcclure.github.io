title = "&quot;Concretely, if someone were to kill all life..."
content = '''&quot;Concretely, if someone were to kill all life on earth, I can&#39;t come up with a logical reason why this is wrong.&quot;<br /><br />You are completely ignoring one of the postulates &quot;All things do not want to die.&quot; You can&#39;t kill something else because if you say that you are allowed to kill something just because you feel like it, then anyone else can use this logic to say that they can kill you if you feel like it, and you don&#39;t want to die, and so you shouldn&#39;t do this. This is exactly what i mean by logically consistent with itself. Your ethical system must be valid when it is applied from you to anything else and from anything else to you. Consequently you can&#39;t kill something for no reason because then anything else can kill you for some reason, and if you don&#39;t want to die, you don&#39;t want this to happen, and so your ethical system is inconsistent. If you DO want to die, this ethical system does not apply to you.<br /><br />This blog post is actually somewhat ad hoc and incomplete, which is why I did not concretely prove anything, I just proposed that all ethics can be derived from those two postulates. Consequently it never actually explained why killing something is, in fact, logically inconsistent unless justified.'''
