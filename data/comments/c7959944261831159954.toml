title = "I think you meant &quot;determinism is impossible&..."
content = "I think you meant &quot;determinism is impossible&quot;. It is not about &#39;managing determinism&#39;, it either is, or isn&#39;t deterministic. Simple as that. It not something you &#39;solve&#39;. The best way for being deterministic is by creating a fixed time step for updating the world (e.g. applying physics 60 times a second, even if the render-FPS is different). I find it really strange that you talk about the impossibility of determinism, we are talking about the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system" rel="nofollow">thing</a> right?. Just download the sample from my website and see that at update-frame #1000 the position of the balls are always the same (no matter at what FPS you&#39;re running at). Determinism is possible. If you claim it isn&#39;t please give me an example.<br /><br />You say extrapolation of position in the render thread is a big no-no. There is absolutely nothing wrong that, I don&#39;t know where you got that idea. There is nothing wrong it as long as you don&#39;t actually modify the state (which I don&#39;t).<br /><br />You also call the internal design of my engine complex to the point it is susceptible to bizarre bugs. Complexity is an &quot;eye of the beholder&quot; thing. I have no problem understanding what is going, maybe it&#39;s too complex from your point of view, but not from mine. However, it is not something I recommend to anybody that is trying to make a game (it is better to use an existing engine).<br /><br />My solution does not have any problems so, I&#39;m not sure why you are saying that we share the same problems.<br /><br />If you manage to convince me that you model is also deterministic, while being able to render at any FPS (without a slow down of the game) than you&#39;ll convince me that your simpler implementation is probably the better one. If you don&#39;t care about a deterministic game (which you don&#39;t, because you don&#39;t even believe in the existence of it) then my way of approaching things must seem unnecessary complex. I totally agree. If you don&#39;t care about stuff like that, then I too would have used a simpler method.<br /><br />P.S. Do you have that link to the CIV V Engine? I really am interested in reading that."
