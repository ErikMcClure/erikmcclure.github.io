content = '''It&#39;s heartbreaking, really. I agree completely, Google has represented an ideal and has been for a long time proof that you can be successful without focusing entirely on money. It still is, in a sense â€” they are now facing more backlash than ever after &quot;focusing on the numbers&quot;.<br /><br />Google is still a good company (far better than a lot of tech companies out there) but they are no longer one of the truly amazing players on the field. Sad.<br />I wonder if long term they&#39;ll recover from it. People never quite trust someone the same way after the trust gets abused.'''
