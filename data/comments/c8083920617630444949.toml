content = '''I can&#39;t speak to any technical aspects of what you&#39;re trying to do because I&#39;m not a programmer.  But what you describe is exactly what *most* artists go through.<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;And then they fade, and I am left staring at a blank wall, frustrated once again by the fact that I can&#39;t make those dreams happen. Even in my one creative outlet, music, I am so incompetent I can only stumble on good ideas by accident, and they are never even remotely related to the orgasmic explosion of amazing sounds I hear in my imagination.<br /><br />That&#39;s Gulley Jimson right there:<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;Not what I meant. Not the vision I had. Why doesnâ€™t it fit like it does in the mind?<br /><br />10,000 Hours For Expertise, Maybe, But Not Artistry<br />http://mikecanex.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/10000-hours-for-expertise-maybe-but-not-artistry/<br /><br />The trouble is, there&#39;s a very fine and dangerous line between having actual talent or a real idea and deluding yourself.<br /><br />Here is massive self-delusion:<br /><br />Self-Confidence Vs. Self-Delusion<br />http://mikecane2008.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/self-confidence-vs-self-delusion/<br /><br />And here is the trap.  If you seek out someone to objectively look at your work and they tell you to let it go and move on, you can further delude yourself by believing they Just Don&#39;t Understand.  On the other hand, if you *don&#39;t* find someone you can totally trust to judge whether or not what you have has anything to it, you will be stuck in a life of bitter frustration never understanding why you can&#39;t move forward.<br /><br />I&#39;m a writer.  But I know my limitations.  I have the same problem you describe in your quote above.  But I&#39;m also very clear about my own limitations and the degree of my frustration.  Some people who think they are writers are not, and they wind up never understanding that their writing goes nowhere simply because it&#39;s not good enough:<br /><br />Why Did You Resign?<br />http://mikecanex.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/why-did-you-resign/<br /><br />Sorry to provide so many links to my own stuff, but as you&#39;ll see, I&#39;ve written about this subject in terms of writers.  I can&#39;t help you with your technical stuff, but I hope you find some clues in these links that will provide a way out or at least some relief or, at the very least, that another person understands what&#39;s compelling you.  Good luck.  I hope you really have something, too.'''
