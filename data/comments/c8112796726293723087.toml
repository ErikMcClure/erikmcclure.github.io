content = "Thanks for the explanation... I see my problem now. If I would have placed the return value of Test() in a character var instead of a pointer, that would have worked, right? Because then it would take the return value of the Test() function and copy it to the character var before &quot;cstm&quot; itself goes out of scope. <br /><br />I didn&#39;t understand why you said my string doesn&#39;t have a null terminator though...?<br /><br />char cstm[] = { &#39;T&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;S&#39;, &#39;T&#39;, &#39;\n&#39; }; <br /><br />I defined the last character as a null terminator?"
