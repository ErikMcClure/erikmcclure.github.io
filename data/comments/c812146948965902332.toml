content = "All Ad Hominems and mug slinging aside, I think this article is genuine (not &#39;bandwagoning&#39;) and can&#39;t be overlooked as immature. I&#39;ve seen 90 year old be childish. We are all children. Its just that some of us learn to not feel anymore- and call ourselves &quot;grown up&quot;. <br /><br />Yea its popular to rag on G+ but like others in the comments section, lets stick to the facts. Google has changed. People are not happy. Until the market presents a better alternative for the still amazing services they provide(search, drive, etc...), I don&#39;t see them going away anytime soon. <br /><br />In the end its the consumer base needs to change their behavior to show the big wigs the their product is no longer competitive. However, they are still very good at what they do and its hard to wean a baby off the teat. That is to say- get all of Google&#39;s userbase to not use Google anymore. A prospect I deem not likely. <br /><br />Sigh kids... smh "
