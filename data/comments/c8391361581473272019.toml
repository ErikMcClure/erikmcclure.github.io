title = '''You pointed out numerous times that Google got it ...'''
content = '''You pointed out numerous times that Google got it right for a few years and as a relativist, that&#39;s about the extent of what I would expect any such company to be able to achieve. I don&#39;t believe any company can maintain total benevolence AND remain totally relevant, powerful, and grow at such an incredible rate. Google may one day control a national automated transportation system...how could that much power and revenue generation not corrupt?<br /><br />This is probably the pessimist in me, but anytime a company I like is &quot;getting it right&quot; I am just waiting for the day they turn. I know with certainty that it will happen. If it ever doesn&#39;t, then its no longer a company, its a religion i.e. something that is illogically benevolent. A fitting quote, &quot;you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain&quot;. Just like Google rose up after Microsoft, another Google full of bright eyed engineers will rise up again. And the cycle repeats. '''
