content = '''I just woke up from a fairly vivid dream that was rather bizarre, although the dreams are usually just weird, not terrifying.<br /><br />When I reconstruct things by myself its usually because I think I will be an order of magnitude more productive by building the engine myself instead of using the existing one, which was why I built my own audio engine and am currently building a GUI toolkit. In both cases, I also had 2 or 3 things I wanted to d that the toolkit simply would not let me do without ludicrous amounts of hacking. So far, my intuition appears to have been right, especially for the audio engine, which I use regularly despite it being partially broken. The graphics engine I&#39;m building myself because there&#39;s a certain thing I want to do that I couldn&#39;t possibly do without my own graphics engine anyway, but this comes later, so its difficult for people to understand until I make that happen. The utility library is an obvious necessity and fairly common among programmers. The game engine was built because now that I had my own graphics and audio engines obviously I needed my own game engine to do anything with them.<br /><br />I&#39;m building my own graphics engine because I love graphics programming. I just don&#39;t give a fuck whether or not its necessary a because I like working on it. Everything else I have built AFTER trying multiple other solutions (I looked at 8 different GUI toolkits and they all sucked miserably). I did not re-implement std::string, I *extended* it. I inherit the class and add a bunch of functionality but still let it do the hard work for me. I still use std::vector whenever I possibly can and only use my re-implementation either as a base for my data structures (because std::vector really, really hates being inherited) or to handle specific performance critical paths.<br /><br />Had I not built my own graphics engine, things would be going a lot faster. But of course, that&#39;s a false statement, because my graphics engine is one of my end goals, not necessarily just the games, so I simply would have fallen for my lie that I actually wanted to build games rather than tools.'''
