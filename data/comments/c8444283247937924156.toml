content = '''&quot;Am I simply getting old? Has the software industry left me behind?&quot;<br /><br />Haha, I&#39;ve had the same thought before.  No, you&#39;re not getting old.  Everyone else is.  The natural curiosity and openness people have when they&#39;re younger is gone as they get sucked into all the structure and bureaucracy.  What you&#39;re struggling to find is anyone who&#39;s kept their individuality intact, people who can make decisions/judgements based on their own internal criteria as opposed to what everyone else thinks.'''
