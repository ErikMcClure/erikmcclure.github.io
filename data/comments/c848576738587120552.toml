content = '''I believe that the result of using any programming language depends heavily on several key factors: The programmer(s), the design, the implementation. In the cases of both C++ and HTML/CSS, everybody has their own idea for how things &#39;ought&#39; to work. So what the programmer gets is a different face for each different implementation with only the core of the language remaining unchanged, at least on the surface.<br />Then the problem becomes more complex, because of the internal workings. On the outside, a given language construct works the way you expect it to, but inside it could be using something that causes minor changes in behavior over a large set of input data (A simple example is the way that different processors handle an illegal div opcode).<br />Of course, C++ and HTML/CSS are among the worst affected languages when it comes to implementation differences. Python, Java and C# are all more or less &#39;single vendor&#39;, or at least the vendors are restricted in what they can do without breaking the language.<br /><br />Apologies for the long reply. But to sum it up, I believe that the language is only as bad as the implementation; that being one of the core reasons I still don&#39;t use Microsoft and Borland compilers. GCC, at the very least, maintains it&#39;s standard across the OS platforms it supports. <br />With regards to HTML and CSS, I&#39;ll just say this: I have been tempted to throw a nice old &quot;This page requires Firefox&quot; message up. Often. Mostly with the CSS side of things.'''
