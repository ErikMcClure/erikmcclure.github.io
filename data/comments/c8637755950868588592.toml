content = '''I have to agree with scott. I only check an icon once my mouse is almost upon it. Habituated usage enables me to find the rough location of a UI element. Colour and 3D should be avoided in icons unless they exceed the area of the tip of a finger, because screen resolutions and viewing distances conspire to make them hard to discern. A monochromatic silhouette suits a small set of frequently used actions whilst not detracting from the colour being used in the website under construction, or source code. Actually, it is preferable to reduce the number of icons even if there is room for a whole lot more. Maya&#39;s shelf makes this error - it also doesn&#39;t help that its icons are 50% too small and relatively rarely used. Given the complexity of the concepts they attempt to represent some kind of hover-to-reveal cyclic animation may help convey their function in the abscence of words. However, ultimately you may be better off using menus; yet, I don&#39;t feel conventional keyboard shortcuts scale to large systems - some hierarchical menu traversal through a chain of mnemonics with Return key confirmation may work better.<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;d like to see the icon bar relocated to the bottom edge of the window and the title bar rotated clockwise through 90 degrees so that the menu bar was on the top edge of the window. That way the mouse could locate targets more easily when the window was maximised even if it overshot as the pointer would be constrained by the boundary of the screen.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for a thought-provoking article.'''
