content = '''You just said you tried specifically to solve the problem of determinancy, when I argue that it is not a significant problem in the first place, due to it needing to be solved elsewhere, and thus you are needlessly solving a problem that doesn&#39;t exist.<br /><br />Non determinism is STILL impossible! All you have done to defend against this point is say that it can be managed, which is exactly what I pointed out.<br /><br />I call your method horrendous because the render thread itself is attempting to extrapolate out positions, which is a big no-no, and you use a complicated object hierarchy, plus the internal design of the engine is complex and therefore susceptible to incredibly bizarre bugs. In fact, everything you do causes the exact problems that made me throw out my own multithreaded implementation due to potentially inconsistent physics states and lag. So if you don&#39;t consider those things to be a problem, then why would you offer your engine as an alternative to mine? Mine does nearly the same thing and has the same problems.<br /><br />You basically did the same thing I did except in a much more roundabout, complicated way. You solved nothing.'''
