content = '''Besides the &#39;flame-war&#39; going on.<br /><br />There are actually many disadvantages from such a multithreaded architecture, but I currently still like it. <br /><br />The need of conceptually dividing the functionality turns out to be positive for maintainability in my case. The borders between the modules are hard to overcome and therefore you can&#39;t take the lazy path of just hacking something in between. A lot of trouble comes from adding fast features that are not separated enough. So in general I found that it makes it easier to work on individual problems. Still the overhead is large.<br /><br />The general problem is that writing a multithreaded game engine isn&#39;t just a work of a few days, therefore the actual performance differences are hard to measure. My current architecture runs with 4 different modules which are basically communicating via double-buffering. And I would also encourage others to pursue a similar path, if they can live with a steep curve of getting things together in the first place. I blieve that separating really pays off when going further along the road. Currently I wouldn&#39;t go back to a single threaded/module approach. Still it is possible that my opinion may change in the future.'''
