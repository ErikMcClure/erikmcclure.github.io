content = '''Well you don&#39;t have to spend more time per day on it, just make sure you keep a certain amount of time allocated to it and you will slowly get better.<br /><br />Remember that progress is exponential. You may feel miniscule progress for years, and then all of the sudden start to &quot;get it&quot;.<br /><br />I don&#39;t mean pirating in that way. I mean pirating the software for creating the effects, not the effects themselves, but you seem to already have all the tools you need.<br /><br />Another thought is, maybe you need to change your approach a little bit on how you are learning to create effects. Something seems to just not be clicking if you&#39;ve been at it for 6 goddamn years. That doesn&#39;t mean you will never get it, it could simply mean you are going about it in the wrong way and need to go back and look at how you are trying to tackle this. Measure your progress and tweak until you start to see change. Easier said than done, but I do know that every human brain has the ability to pick up this sort of stuff over time.<br /><br />But anyways, we digress from the main topic of discussion. Imo though, music is incredible important for creativity. It&#39;s not the only creative outlet but it is one that touches on every part of the creative process. It keeps you sharp. Keep at it!'''
