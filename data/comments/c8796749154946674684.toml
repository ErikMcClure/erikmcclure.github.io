content = "I&#39;m sorry, I was paying too much attention to your suggested solutions rather than the problem at hand: improving (game) graphics. You said it yourself: ray tracing doesn&#39;t solve it. So you need different solutions, and rather than critizize your ideas I should have suggested other options.<br /><br />In any case, your observations are correct: there is definitely room for improvement. I&#39;ve had similar ideas myself over the past 3 decades. But so far I&#39;ve never managed to come up with an original idea that hadn&#39;t been invented and implemented already. Maybe you can be more successful than that.<br /><br />3D gaming is quite old now. The first game presenting pseudo-realistic graphics was released almost 20 years ago (check out &quot;The 7th guest&quot;). And when I look at todays graphics, little has changed since then, at least on first glance. <br /><br />When I compare my memories of that game to todays&#39; games I realize I was wrong in some of my earlier statements: The only things that notably changed are the improved physics, and increased number and detail of objects. And it sure looks better! But look at the cost: our computers are a thousandfold more powerful than those of 1993, and still the animations appear to be lacking.<br /><br />Yes, more details would improve the graphics, but that&#39;s what has been done for 20 years, and it comes at the cost of computing power. If you want something game-changing (literally), you should either think of some alternate algortihms that don&#39;t cost as much as the current ones, or find other aspects of the game (graphics or other) that would be worth improving.<br /><br />It may be worth checking out current developments at Pixar: they&#39;re working on an incredibly complex physical model of curly hair in &#39;Brave&#39;. If you can think of something simpler that could be introduced in real time graphics for gaming that would be something! It *is* about details too, just not the far off ones that Nathan and I suggested can be ignored for the most part. Instead it&#39;s the detail right in front of your camera."
