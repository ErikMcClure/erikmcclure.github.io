A &quot;guide on the side&quot; teacher/mentor is a better model.  The responsibility of learning needs to be removed from the teacher and placed upon the student from a young age.  In fact, get rid of classrooms - it&#39;s an obsolete concept.  Humans live and work collaboratively in small groups with shared abilities and interests.  Organize schools in the same way - let the kids who are obsessed with a given topic collaborate with other like minded kids in other parts of the world.  Kids should learn fact hard facts on their own and practice problem solving in &quot;class&quot; with a trained teacher mentor to enforce high expectations.<br /><br />Education is NOT one size fits all.  Not every kid deserves a trophy for just showing up to the games. We need to embrace the fact that not every child is going to be a college graduate.  The modern American High School is very successful at sending kids out the door with NO marketable skills.  Not ready for college math or English.  Can&#39;t code a program.  Can&#39;t cook a meal.  Can&#39;t fix a leaky pipe or change a tire.  Can&#39;t tell the difference between facts and opinions on a Google search.  Can&#39;t think independently.  Can&#39;t write an effective argument. Turn half of all High Schools into &quot;magnet schools&quot; with a strong career track. Start training plumbers, electricians, mechanics, machinists, etc. in 1/2 day High Schools with a 1/2 day working.  You go on a college track or an apprentice track starting in 10th grade. All AP level classes in the college track.  Prom is over rated.  Every non-college bound high school student I know wants to be a chef or a dolphin trainer.  Let them start working in a commercial kitchen or mucking stalls for 4 hours a day at age 15 - that&#39;s education.<br /><br />Close all for profit &quot;colleges&quot; (ITT Technical Institute, Culinary Art Institutes, etc. - any school who runs TV ads during Springer)  These &quot;schools&quot; are simply scams to burden poor memorizers / regurgitators with government backed student loans.  These institutions are criminal.<br /><br />Did I enjoy teaching for a year in a public school.  Yes!  Incredibly rewarding, challenging, exciting, thrilling. Amazing students. Became friends with many dedicated and talented teachers. Learned you can change a life forever. <br /><br />Did I hate teaching for a year in a public school.  Yes!  Low pay. Apathetic parents. Long hours. People assume I&#39;m stupid or lazy or a loser because I teach in a middle school.  Mean students. Students with hormones raging.  Apathetic teachers.  Recognizing that you can&#39;t change the system.<br /><br />I look very forward to teaching next year.  I can&#39;t wait apply what I learned in year one.  I know I made a ton of mistakes can&#39;t wait to try a ton of new things.  I already miss the daily interactions with the students.  On the other hand, I might relax and take the easy $90,000 job that will pay the bills and let me enjoy my last 15 years of employment.  That is why I wrote this post - to decide if I am teaching next year....<br />"
