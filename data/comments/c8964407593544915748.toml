content = "I might be a jerk for saying this, but, I loved this post. Not because of the hilarious honesty. <br />Not because of the witty writing. <br />Not because of the foolhardy but charming ambition of a student programmer. <br />Not even because of the shared pathos of failure that gives this piece its power. <br />I loved it, because being a graduating senior at a similarly competitive university, its nice to know that I&#39;m not the only one whose constantly failing to meet his own objectives and falling behind the path his idols set. <br />Thank you for that. May Misery be thy Muse xD."
