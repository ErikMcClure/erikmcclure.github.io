content = "Part 2...<br /><br />College and University &quot;Schools&quot; of Education.   I recently completed a master&#39;s degree in education.  Complete and utter waste of time.  Mindless edubabble.   Taught me absolutely NOTHING about successfully teaching in public schools.  We should immediately eliminate ALL university based education classes.  Math teachers should have math degrees.  English teachers should have degrees in English.  Elementary teachers should have university degrees with significant coursework in both the hard sciences and social sciences.  All teachers should complete a full year of student teaching under the close supervision of a team of master teachers.  The bottom 25% of all student teachers should never be allowed to teach.  Not everyone can sing on key or dunk a basketball... You can&#39;t teach everyone to teach.<br /><br />Culture of learning.  Virtually all public schools lack a strong culture of learning. The only exceptions are elite private prep schools and a handful of truly exemplary charter schools like KIPP Academy.  These schools have incredibly high expectations for both students and educators.  KIPP takes poor inner-city minority kids and turns them into motivated scholars with the confidence and ability to pass the high stakes tests that (rightly or wrongly) determine success in America.  Long school days, tons of homework, a balance of rote memorization and higher level thinking skills.  Teachers so dedicated they spend many nights on their cell phones tutoring students. <br /><br />High Stakes Tests.  Success in higher education is primarily based upon your ability to effectively memorize and regurgitate facts into little bubbles.  Law, medicine, engineering, math and advanced business degrees are exclusively granted to those who can quickly and competently memorize and regurgitate.  Wikipedia and smart phones apps have completely eliminated the need for this skill.  We now have free and instant access to virtually all known factual information 24/7/365 regardless of our physical location on earth.  We should value the worth of humans on their ability to collaboratively search, filter, manage, integrate and implement factual knowledge to prioritize and solve real problems.  Modern capitalism is relatively successful at this.  Public education is not.  Sadly, students are completely excluded from the highest levels of the game (MD, PhD, MBA, JD, Computer Science) unless they master the memorization / regurgitation in high stakes testing trick (or have wealthy relatives who can make a &quot;call&quot; on their behalf, i.e. George H W Bush)    <br /><br />Textbooks / Technology.  All modern K-12 textbooks are very expensive garbage.  All printed textbooks should be banned.  All students should be given a $250 Chromebook and do almost everything digitally.  Yes, schools should have regular activities that are &quot;technology free&quot; and require getting hands-on dirty... But, almost everything from fine art to frog dissection to group projects can be done better virtually.  FYI - almost every public school teacher over age 40 has HORRIBLE technology skills.  This is a huge impediment to meaningful change in education over the next two decades.  50 year old CEO&#39;s either have technology skills or hire people who do to work for them.  By the time all our techno-dinosaur teachers retire our schools will be even further behind the rest of the world.<br /><br /><br />"
