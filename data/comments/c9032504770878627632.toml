content = "I have to admit that getting a job probably isn&#39;t the end of the world, I&#39;m just frustrated at my lack of progress. I feel like I should have been much, much farther along than I am, and because of that I feel like a failure. This probably isn&#39;t true, but I&#39;m just tired. Tired of having fought against failure for years and years and years and getting beaten down over and over and having to get up again and again and again. I&#39;m just tired.<br /><br />Maybe I need a vacation."
