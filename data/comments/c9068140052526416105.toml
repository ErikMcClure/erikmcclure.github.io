content = "I already pay attention to John Carmack but lately what he&#39;s been delving into separates from my own personal avenues of research. In particular he seems to be jumping on the texel-based rendering bandwagon, which I have many objections to.<br /><br />I would like to note that my engine can still &quot;run&quot; at any FPS I want with a constant physics timestep, its just that no physics objects will move during the update. Technically, animations and other things would still run, and in fact I could implement my own interpolation if I wanted to, but it would still be deterministic.<br /><br />At this point I&#39;m going to make it so my engine can either use a variable timestep or a constant timestep, which then lets the game using the engine choose whether or not it wants to be deterministic."
