You do pretty much everything I&#39;ve wanted to learn, Erik. <br /><br />Graphics programming with an efficient mindset. Mostly all I&#39;ve done is high-level business apps and very few graphics programming. I would LOVE to write a 3D engine, but I&#39;ve always felt the maths behind it and the resources to learn are way out of my reach. Hopefully one day I can exercise half the skill set you have! Ha!"
