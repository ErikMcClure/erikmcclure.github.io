content = "I&#39;ve tried to comment as a consequentialist; rereading, it does seem to have come out strangely. That post is, to a significant extent, addressed to a past version of myself who appears to my view to be similar to you, based on this post and the last few here. I followed the path of least resistance through college, then through two years of a regular programming job that didn&#39;t match my actual dreams. I was able to return to building the stuff I actually dreamed of and cared about; minor mind modifications and a bit of lifestyle engineering were, as it turns out, key. Now, maybe I&#39;ve projected traits of mine onto you, and said things that were off the mark. If so, feel free to ignore them. A few of the things I said were mere guesses, based only on patterns I&#39;ve seen."
