content = '''Your post does not appear to be trying to prove or argue that ethics has a logical basis.  It instead seems like you are saying, &quot;because ethics has a logical basis this is my logical reasoning for my following conclusions ...&quot;  So you are assuming that ethics can have a logical basis and then making statements on top of that assumption.<br /><br />I believe that people should behave ethically and morally, but I don&#39;t believe that this directive comes from the application of logic.<br /><br />Succinctly, I can&#39;t think of any logical reason that Nihilism is incorrect, can you?  Concretely, if someone were to kill all life on earth, I can&#39;t come up with a logical reason why this is wrong.  I wouldn&#39;t like such a thing if it happened, but this dislike comes from the assumption that life is good (a conclusion that I cannot come to using purely logic).  <br /><br />Indeed, if the goal is to minimize suffering, then consider the following:  The more life that exists the greater potential there is for suffering (worse case scenario is that every living thing is suffering to the maximum extent).  Therefore the more life that exists, the greater the amount of suffering is possible.  One way to minimize this suffering would be to end all life.  Suffering is now zero.<br /><br />Now I find the idea of an all encompassing genocide abhorrent, but I have problems debating it on the sole merit of suffering minimization.<br /><br />Another issue with logical morality is Godel&#39;s incompleteness theorem.  If your logic ethics framework is not able to encode peano arithmetic then it is incomplete.  If it is able to encode peano arithmetic then Godel&#39;s theorem applies and there are true statements which are unprovable (or moral choices which are right, but which we cannot prove logically are right).  <br /><br />I am not trying to be hard on you, I am merely unconvinced by your position.  I was excited to find this blog entry because I think that the best way to learn is to pay attention to people clearly explaining their opposing point of view.  Even though I have not been swayed, considering your words has allowed me to have some new thoughts, for which I am thankful. (specifically, this is the first time that I have thought about the possible consequences of a logical ethics framework as it relates to some of Godel&#39;s work).<br /><br />Bias Disclaimer:  I am a Christian, (paid as a) software engineer, (educated as a) computer scientist, (amateur) mathematician, (fan of) science fiction, gamer.'''
