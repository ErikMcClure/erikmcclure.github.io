content = '''Oh my god, I think we would be great friends.  Look it sounds like you started out wanting to make games, and realized what you really wanted to do is program, and there is for sure nothing wrong with that!  <br /><br />You know games are not the be all and end all of life, and my advice to you is get into science!  I think part of the problem is that making games, or tools to help make games, ultimately feels pointless (source: I am a lifelong hardcore gamer), but when you do science you can really feel proud that you are making a contribution to civilization.  Do you like machine learning?  It&#39;s fking awsome!  http://scikit-learn.org/stable/'''
