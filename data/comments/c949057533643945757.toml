content = "Trying to stop people from illegally downloading your music is NOT an effective marketing strategy. If you don&#39;t upload the songs to youtube, someone else will, and if you take those down, someone ELSE will, in an endless cycle. Both Bandcamp and Soundcloud can be bypassed by digging into the temporary files cache. Anything else can be bypassed by simply recording what&#39;s coming out of your speakers. The most I do is prevent any actual download buttons so people understand that I expect them to buy the songs, but attempting to stop them from illegally downloading the songs is a waste of time. What&#39;s more important is exposure that directs people to an online store where they can purchase it."
