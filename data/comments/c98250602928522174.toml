content = "I understand your frustration, yet can never empathize with you as much as I&#39;d like. I went to design school, a different beast, but one still constricted by getting students across the line. The resources are just not there a lot of the time. The faculty&#39;s hands are tied, by strings reaching higher than one would either like, or imagine. <br /><br />I feel if you can&#39;t succinctly get your alternative ideas across, then perhaps they&#39;re not as considered as they could be. Infact, if they&#39;re alternatives that you&#39;re admitting won&#39;t work, then aren&#39;t they just pipe dreams? Nothing wrong with publishing these: dreams have their uses, banners to form under, but maybe energy would be better spent on baby stepped agents of change instead of elaborate idealist overhauls and restructuring. As a adamant idealist myself, it&#39;s a thought I never like to admit. Never the less, the world is always hungry for new ideas, especially ones that beg questions. <br /><br />I think a possible vector of interest would be education about education. Give students an awareness of the issues at the ground level, something as simple as having 1st graders asking the teacher &quot;why are we doing this?&quot; ad nauseum<br />until the teacher themselves are filled from toe to brim with the same burning question. Kids like me and you often don&#39;t care about these things until we&#39;re through the gauntlet; the blinders are on when we&#39;re running it. But I remember a time when no blinders were on, when I was an obnoxious questioning youth at an age where grades and performance didn&#39;t all that much matter when my future was concerned. It&#39;s that time, I feel, when you can rile up a bit of care in students about what they&#39;re actually doing and participating in daily. Put the pressure on from the ground up, the top is too strong, yet without the bottom, they&#39;re gone. "
