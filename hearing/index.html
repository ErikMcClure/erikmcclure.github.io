<p>Performing a hearing test outside of ideal conditions with unknown hardware is usually useless, because what you're likely doing is measuring the frequency response range of your <b>speakers</b>, not your ears. If, however, you have studio monitor speakers that are rated to go up to 20kHz, you can at least test up to there. Even then, a lot of online "hearing tests" use MP3 files, which invalidates everything because compression could introduce tonal distortions or remove the frequency entirely due to a low pass, and MP3s are usually encoded at 44.1kHz, which has a nyquist frequency of 22050Hz, which itself can introduce potential weirdness at 22kHz, so this test uses 24-bit .wav at a 48kHz sampling rate. Note that this can <i>still</i> introduce problems depending on your sound hardware if the hardware itself does not want to go above a 41.1kHz limit, so it may get resampled down to 44.1kHz by your OS, and thus under most circumstances the highest meaningful result from this test is at 20kHz.
